<h1 title="">THE MYSTERY AT CAMP LENAPE</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">BATTLE-ROYAL</span></h2>
<p>The Utway twins were at it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are, too!&rdquo; said Jake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re another!&rdquo; said Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re his brother!&rdquo; said Jake.</p>
<p>It was &ldquo;quiet hour&rdquo; in Camp Lenape. The
peace of Sunday afternoon hung above the rows
of white tents on the hillside above the placid
lake. In Tent Ten, however, the quiet was
broken by a sudden uproar.</p>
<p>Six wide-awake lads perched on upper bunks,
grinning and nudging each other. All eyes were
turned on two bronze-haired, blue-eyed, sun-browned
boys who faced each other in the center
of the tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>As they stood thus, it seemed as if there was
only one boy, looking at himself in a large
mirror; for the Utway twins were so much alike
that others often wondered how one of them
knew whether he was himself, or his brother&mdash;whether
Jerry did not sometimes wake in the
morning and think for a moment that he might
possibly be Jake. The resemblance was heightened
by the fact that both wore identical outfits&mdash;the
basketball shorts and green-and-white jersey
that served as the camp uniform.</p>
<p>However, while Jerry wore a tennis sneaker on
each foot, Jake wore only one. The other shoe
he brandished in an upraised arm with a threatening
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s talking,&rdquo; put in &ldquo;wild Willie&rdquo;
Sanders, from his perch above the two brothers.
&ldquo;You tell him, Jake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake turned on the speaker. &ldquo;No noise from
the nickel seats!&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;This is our
business&mdash;no butting in. Now, Jerry, take back
what you said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, take back what you said!&rdquo; responded
Jerry with some spirit. &ldquo;And quit aiming that
shoe at me! Put it down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep off!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The band of onlookers, now reinforced by the
grinning faces of many inmates of neighboring
tents, chuckled with delight. It looked as if there
was going to be a fight at last. And the watchers
knew from past experience that if the Utway
twins got to scrapping again, the resulting action
would do much to brighten up a dull Sunday
afternoon. Therefore they waited happily for
the first gong of the coming battle.</p>
<p>It looked as though Jerry meant business.
With a swift rush he attempted to snatch the
menacing shoe from his brother&rsquo;s hand. Jake
neatly dodged, and swung the improvised
weapon in a dangerous arc. His fingers slipped
on the smooth rubber of the sole, and the shoe
hurled itself with some force at Jerry&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>Jerry grunted as the flying sneaker took him
in the midriff. He was not hurt, but he was mad.
He had forgotten completely what the original
quarrel was about; he knew that the shoe had
been flung by accident, but didn&rsquo;t care; all he
thought of was to &ldquo;get even&rdquo; with Jake. He
snatched the nearest thing at hand, which happened
to be a canteen belonging to little Pete
Lister, and flung it wildly at his brother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Jake dodged again, and returned this fire with
an unwieldy missile that proved to be Fat
Crampton&rsquo;s generously-built raincoat. This went
wild of the mark, and he ducked a whizzing flashlight
while at the same time reaching about for
more ammunition. His hand touched &ldquo;Sherlock&rdquo;
Jones&rsquo;s camera-case, and he was about to
aim this at Jerry&rsquo;s head when he was taken full
in the face with a canvas pillow, followed by a
sweater and a Boy Scout Handbook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; cried Jones, jumping down from his
bunk in alarm, now that his treasured possession
was in danger, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my camera-case you got!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contested object sailed past his ear and
met its mark on Jerry&rsquo;s leg. By this time Jerry
was in no frame of mind to distinguish friend
from enemy. He was seeing red, and the sight
of young Jones dashing toward him to regain his
property raised his temper to the boiling point.
He reached out and greeted the oncoming boy
with the contents of a handy water-bucket.</p>
<p>The bucket was half full, sufficient to make a
drenching torrent which reduced the hapless
Jones to a sopping state. His cry of rage filled
the tent. Wild Willie Sanders came to his rescue,
and together they advanced on Jerry, who was
now armed with a loose tent-peg swinging on the
end of its rope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Jake had taken advantage of his momentary
freedom from attack to gather together a goodly
pile of ammunition&mdash;shoes, tennis rackets, pinecones,
pillows, and an empty wasp&rsquo;s nest which
Lefkowitz had collected as a specimen. Chink
Towner had entrenched himself on the top of a
bunk, from which fortified position he was able
now and then to swipe the tumbling combatants
over the head with a pillow. Little Peter Lister
managed to give Fat Crampton a timely shove
which sent him rolling between the legs of his
battling tent-mates.</p>
<p>Objects of all sorts, from baseball bats to cakes
of soap, flew through the air and landed in the
low bushes outside the tent. Battle-cries and
shouts of the wounded rent the calm Sunday
afternoon air.</p>
<p>The fight was no longer a private contest. The
action had become general. A whirling shoe had
landed on &ldquo;Kipper&rdquo; Dabney, aide of Tent Nine
next door, and he had immediately led his cohorts
in a vengeful sally against their warlike neighbors.
Somebody had refilled the empty water-pail
and was methodically doing his bit to make
sure that not one of the combatants was left
undrenched. A scouting party from Tent Five
had raced downhill and were swiftly pulling the
blankets from every bunk and tossing them into
the huckleberry bushes. Tent Ten was a battleground
of whirling arms, tumbling bodies, and
flying weapons, whereon no one knew his friend,
and every boy fought for himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shrill voice of command cut through the
tumult. Unseen by the rioters, a short, erect
man in scoutmaster&rsquo;s uniform had appeared in
their midst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop this at once! Put those things down!
Attention!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A boy on the outskirts of the group whistled
in surprise. &ldquo;Chickie! It&rsquo;s Mr. Colby!&rdquo; He
dodged behind a tree and disappeared. Silently
the boys from other tents faded from the scene,
trying to look innocent and peaceful. In ten
seconds the members of Tent Ten were left alone
amid the ruins, under the stern gaze of Mr.
Colby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention! Line up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eight boys guiltily straightened, heels together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Utway, drop that baseball bat! Now,
what&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The councilor&rsquo;s keen eyes flashed from one face
to the next. The sudden uproar had brought him
running from his place at the leaders&rsquo; meeting on
the porch of the lodge. As officer of the day,
it was his duty to take charge of the camp program,
inspect the tents, and assign merit points
for the conduct of each tent-group. He took his
duties most seriously; a short period of service in
the National Guard had given him a mighty respect
for military discipline; and his strictness at
all times was well-known at Lenape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men, you are a disgrace!&rdquo; he snapped. A
few feathers from a ripped pillow sifted down
and settled upon the brim of his hat, but not a
boy dared to smile. &ldquo;A disgrace! Now, who&rsquo;s
responsible for this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His searching eye caught sight of the twins,
standing together at one end of the line. He
well knew the reputation these husky brothers
had for unladylike conduct, and twice before had
found it necessary to separate them from each
other&rsquo;s grasp after sudden tussles. His lips
tightened as he stopped before Jerry, whose relinquished
baseball bat lay across his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You again, eh? Fighting with your brother,
were you, Jake? Or Jerry, whichever you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind accusing anybody else! You&rsquo;ll
have to learn that camp is no place for continual
bickering! Look at this tent! You&rsquo;ve made hay
of the whole place. I&rsquo;ll make it my job to see
that Tent Ten gets the booby can for this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
The councilor&rsquo;s words were broken off short,
and he fell back, clapping his hands to his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>He had been standing directly under the front
tent pole, and the oil lantern hanging there,
which had somehow escaped being brought into
the fray, had suddenly descended from its nail
at the top of the pole and struck him full on the
crown. The blow had been partly dulled by his
stiff hat, but he was smarting with anger. His
bristling gaze fell on the flushed face of Jake
Utway, who stood beside the pole with defiance
in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you did that, Utway! Don&rsquo;t deny
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake did not deny it. He had taken this means
of defending his brother from the full brunt of
the guilt for the battle-royal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you stop picking on Jerry?
He wasn&rsquo;t the only one to blame! All of us did
some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;Both you boys are incorrigible!
Now, listen! You two must put this tent
in order at once&mdash;pick up everything, make all
the beds, put everything in its place! If this is
not done, I shall recommend that you serve ten
hours apiece on the chain gang. No discipline&mdash;no
discipline&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Still rubbing his injured brow tenderly, the
enraged scoutmaster rushed from the tent, not
daring to trust his temper further.</p>
<p>The group relaxed. &ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;ll fix you
guys for soaking me with all that water,&rdquo; muttered
Sherlock Jones. &ldquo;Serves you right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; said Jerry rudely. &ldquo;Say, Jake,
thanks. He sure did look sad when that lantern
bopped him! I knew right away you did it on
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, he was picking on you,&rdquo; answered Jake.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. He got even with us, though.
It&rsquo;s not going to be an easy job, cleaning up this
mess. Let&rsquo;s get busy. Come on, pick up those
blankets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re no cripple&mdash;pick &rsquo;em up yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick &rsquo;em up, you lazy loafer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a loafer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re another!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re his brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Utway twins were at it again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SHERLOCK ON THE TRAIL</span></h2>
<p>Sherlock Jones muttered vengefully
to himself as he slowly stripped and removed
his sopping clothes after the battle. Moodily he
donned a dry outfit, pulled a sweater over his
head, and stalked from the littered tent.</p>
<p>Between two pine trees a few yards away, a
rustic bench had been built. Sherlock sat down,
drew a thin book from his pocket, and began to
read. He had barely cast his eye down one page
when a shadow fell on his arm, and he looked up
to see Wild Willie Sanders surveying him curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s bitin&rsquo; you?&rdquo; asked Wild Willie.
&ldquo;You look mad as a wet hen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sherlock scowled. &ldquo;Something terrible&rsquo;s going
to happen around this camp!&rdquo; he said with a
profound air of secrecy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The other boy laughed scornfully. &ldquo;Huh!
That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re always saying! Always acting
mysterious, as if you thought somebody was
going to commit a murder any minute! Reading
that book again, too, I see! What&rsquo;s the name of
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a swift movement, he jerked the thin
volume from Sherlock&rsquo;s hand, and read the title.
&ldquo;&lsquo;How to Be a Detective in 10 Lessons, by the
Fireside Correspondence School.&rsquo; Say, what
makes you think you&rsquo;re a natural-born sleuth,
anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sherlock peered up pleadingly, blinking his
pale blue eyes behind the large, window-like
lenses of a pair of horn-rimmed glasses that
rested on his long, inquisitive nose. &ldquo;Here, give
me that, Wild Willie! Give me back that book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Detective.&rdquo; The boy tossed
the book down, and grunted. &ldquo;Say, you better
quit shadowing Chink Towner all over the place.
He&rsquo;s getting mad about it, and told me he&rsquo;d swat
you one if you didn&rsquo;t stop following him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Sherlock gave him a solemn glance.
&ldquo;Shh! I got information that he&rsquo;s a smuggler!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A smuggler? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, he&rsquo;s probably a Chinese spy
in disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Wild Willie laughed derisively. &ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ve
known Chink Towner all my life, and he&rsquo;s no
more a smuggler than the Chief is! Why he&rsquo;s not
even a Chinaman&mdash;we just call him Chink because
he kind of looks that way. You better get these
nutty ideas out of your head before you get hurt.
It&rsquo;s just like that time you told me that Leggy
and all the other colored fellows in the kitchen
were counterfeiters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sherlock winced. This affair was another of
his failures to discover a secret threat of Crime
hanging over the heads of his fellow campers.
One evening soon after the camp season had
started, he had been listening outside the shack
where these dusky young men lived, back of the
ice-house, and had heard the whirr of machinery
and the proud voice of Leggy, assistant cook, remarking:
&ldquo;Yas suh, dis here ma-sheen is sure
goin&rsquo; to make lots o&rsquo; money for us all!&rdquo; His
hope of fame as a great detective was blasted
next day in mess-hall, however, when that same
Leggy announced that he had &ldquo;brought a sewing-machine
to camp with him and was prepared, for
a nominal sum of money, to mend rips and tears
in the campers&rsquo; clothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about that,&rdquo; he said desperately.
&ldquo;People around this camp are going to be pretty
glad they&rsquo;ve got a live-wire detective on the job.
Pretty soon you&rsquo;ll wish you&rsquo;d listened to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;s going to happen?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some people around here will bear watching,
that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; Sherlock cast a meaning glance in
the direction of Tent Ten, where the twins had
set about clearing up the devastated tent and
making up the bunks into a semblance of orderliness.</p>
<p>Wild Willie stared in unbelief, and again broke
into a laugh. &ldquo;You mean the Utway brothers?
Say, if you take my advice, you&rsquo;ll keep away
from those two! Everybody knows they scrap
with each other now and then, but if you try to
tackle one of them, you&rsquo;ll have both of them
coming down on your neck! What have you got
against them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sherlock slowly, &ldquo;Jake threw
around my good camera-case, and Jerry dumped
a whole bucket of water on me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no crime, is it? What&rsquo;s mysterious
about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see. Look at what they did to Mr.
Colby&mdash;Jake knocked down a lantern on him, on
purpose, and I bet they&rsquo;d like to do worse, if they
could. And he&rsquo;s a councilor!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a born chump,&rdquo; remarked his tent-mate
hopelessly. &ldquo;No use trying to argue with
you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes Junior. Some day,
something terrible is going to happen around
camp, and then you&rsquo;ll be a hero and discover the
mystery. <i>Oh</i>, yes!&rdquo; Again came that scornful
laugh. &ldquo;Listen, there goes the bugle sounding
Recall. Sax McNulty promised to tell some
stories before swim, up at the big cherry tree.
Are you coming, or are you going to read your
old book all day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go ahead. I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo; Sherlock
again picked up his precious book, but he did not
read far. As soon as Wild Willie was out of
sight, he slipped the book into his pocket. He
was convinced that the Utway twins were a pair
of villains. If he could catch them in some dark
act, and unmask them as dire disturbers of the
peace of Camp Lenape&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Already a plan had formed in his mind. He
would hide near them, watch their movements,
and if possible discover them in some suspicious
act.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The campus between the rows of tents was deserted
now. Again silence hovered over Camp
Lenape, scene of many a summer adventure,
some of which have been written down elsewhere.
The spreading lodge-building, perched on the
hillside midway between the mountain range and
the waters of Lake Lenape, was deserted. In the
shadow by the kitchen door, Sherlock could
see Ellick, the jovial, chocolate-colored chef,
sprawled on the ground beside his three coffee-colored
assistants, resting after their labors of
preparing the midday meal of camp fare. The
waiting lad could picture in his mind the scene
under the wild-cherry tree in the baseball field
beyond the lodge, where a dozen grown men, the
councilors, sat, surrounded by the hundred lively
boy campers who each season came to live under
canvas in the woods and to enjoy the delights of
this outdoor paradise. &ldquo;Sax&rdquo; McNulty, the
comical leader who was in charge of camp stunts,
would be relating some stirring tale. All the
other councilors would be there&mdash;Wally Rawn,
the swimmer; Lieutenant Eames of West Point
fame; Mr. Colby; Happy Face Frayne, the associate
director; and the rest. And somewhere
among the group of listening boys would be the
Chief himself, the kindly director who knew all
things.</p>
<p>Among the crowd, Sherlock&rsquo;s absence would
not be noticed. He rose swiftly, and managed
to creep unseen into a clump of low bushes about
fifty yards below Tent Ten. From this vantage-point
he was able to overlook the activity of the
two brothers, who labored moodily at their task
in the hot sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>It was no easy thing to discover all the missing
objects which the energetic raiders from other
tents had thrown into the surrounding shrubbery,
and to arrange everything inside in apple-pie
order for a later inspection; and the better part
of an hour passed before Jake and Jerry sat on
a newly-made bunk and rested from their labors.</p>
<p>Sherlock, who had patiently squatted within
the depths of a distant huckleberry patch all the
while, now saw his chance to creep undiscovered
to the space under the flooring of the tent, where
he could listen and perhaps overhear some incriminating
words. Expertly he wormed his way to
this hiding-place, behind the unsuspecting backs
of the brothers, in time to catch the end of Jake&rsquo;s
last remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;you&rsquo;re right, Jerry. We sure ought to do
something. Everybody was in on the scrap, and
Colby didn&rsquo;t have any right to put all this work
on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too strict, with all his talk about discipline,&rdquo;
responded Jerry somberly. &ldquo;From now
on he&rsquo;s going to be after us, especially when you
pushed the tent-pole and brought that lantern
down on his dome; so we might as well be hung
for a sheep as a lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff! What&rsquo;ll we do to him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Sherlock, below them, stifled a gasp of horror.
Here was mutiny, rank rebellion against the authority
of a councilor of Lenape, a grown man
and a scoutmaster! His jaw gaped as he listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking,&rdquo; said Jerry slowly. &ldquo;I
bet old Colby could be scared out of his skin, even
if he was a soldier once. You know that big bull-frog
Spaghetti Megaro caught the other day? I
know where he keeps it down in my tent. Let&rsquo;s
get it, and to-night, about twelve o&rsquo;clock when
everybody&rsquo;s asleep, we&rsquo;ll slide down to Colby&rsquo;s
tent and chuck old Mr. Frog into his bed! Talk
about scared! Say, I&rsquo;ll bet Old Discipline will
let out a yelp you can hear a mile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, I can just hear it now!&rdquo; agreed Jake,
bursting into a laugh. &ldquo;But how are we going
to stay awake that long? Twelve o&rsquo;clock&rsquo;s pretty
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix that. I can wake up whenever I want
to, you know. We can run a long string across
from my tent over here. Tie one end to your foot
before you go to sleep. When I wake up I&rsquo;ll give
it a pull and wake you up, then get the frog, and
meet you here. Then we&rsquo;ll go down to Fifteen
and give Mr. Discipline the scare of his life!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;All set. I got a ball of cord in my locker we
can use. Come on, Jerry&mdash;we got time enough
before swim to listen in on one of Sax McNulty&rsquo;s
stories. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Day is done, gone the sun,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>From the lake, from the hills, from the sky&mdash;</i></p>
</div>
<p>The full, rich notes of Taps rolled over the
pines of Lenape and echoed across the lake. Fat
Crampton doused the Tent Ten lantern and
climbed heavily into his creaking bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, campers!&rdquo; drawled the voice of
Jim Avery, the lanky councilor. Sleepy voices
answered from the darkness. There was a slight
rustling from the direction of Jake Utway&rsquo;s
bunk. Sherlock Jones cocked an ear. He knew
that Jake, following the plan he had overheard
that afternoon, was attaching to his foot the cord
which the twins had laid down after nightfall to
connect Tent Ten with Jerry&rsquo;s bunk in Tent
Eight down the line. This method of communication
was necessary because the Chief in his wisdom
made it a point to separate the two devoted
brothers into different tent-groups when the
changes in tent assignments were made at the
end of each two-week period of camp. Therefore
Jake was given a place with Mr. Avery, while
Jerry was nominally under the guardianship of
Dr. Cannon in Tent Eight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Sherlock smiled with satisfaction in the darkness.
He, too, had a score to pay off, and he
would see that the brothers who had misused him
would not get off lightly. His preparations were
made. Cautiously he felt under his bunk to make
sure that all the equipment he needed was at
hand.</p>
<p>A few stars sparkled down through the softly-swaying
pine branches. Nothing was heard in
the tent now save the heavy breathing of the
weary sleepers, led by Fat Crampton&rsquo;s rumbling
bass snore. Far up the mountain behind camp
a dog barked somewhere. The travelling spot of
a flashlight came up the path as the Chief passed
by noiselessly on his nightly round. Sherlock
caught himself nodding&mdash;tried to jerk himself
into wakefulness&mdash;nodded again....</p>
<p>He woke with a start. A dim bulk of shadow
moved against the dull starlight; Jake Utway
was dressing hastily in the dark. He waited until
Jake had slipped on his tennis shoes and had
noiselessly tiptoed down the steps. A light footfall
from the path told him that Jerry was joining
the party. &ldquo;Got the frog?&rdquo; he heard Jake
whisper; the forms of the two brothers melted
into the dark in the direction of Tent Fifteen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Sherlock waited no longer. He sprang from
his blankets, and stripped off his pajamas. He
had, unseen by his tent-mates, slipped into bed
fully dressed beneath his nightwear. It was the
work of a few instants to slide his feet into a pair
of moccasins and drop over the edge of the tent
floor. Clutched under one arm he carried his
camera, his most prized possession. In the other
hand he bore a metal pan with a short handle, and
a package labeled &ldquo;flashlight powder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE MIDNIGHT MAN</span></h2>
<p>Through the gloom the Utway twins felt
their way down the hill, trusting to the touch
of their feet to keep them on the path that ran
through the pines on the northern edge of the
campus. Jerry carried under his sweater the
bulging form of the big frog, whose long legs
jerked fitfully.</p>
<p>Jake grabbed his brother&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; he
whispered. &ldquo;I thought I heard something over
to the right&mdash;there in the bushes!&rdquo; They listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be dreaming still! I don&rsquo;t hear
anything. Come on! You aren&rsquo;t scared, are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, say! Let&rsquo;s hurry up, though. We don&rsquo;t
want to get caught. You still got Alexander
good and tight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Jerry resisted a particularly violent kick from
Alexander, the frog, and again moved forward.
They were now close to the dull patch of canvas
that marked Tent Fifteen, the tent furthest away
from the lodge. The twins had marked beforehand
the lower bunk occupied by Mr. Colby,
which was on the far side. With the greatest
caution, the twins circled through the underbrush
and crept beneath the moorings of the tent-ropes.
The councilor&rsquo;s bunk was now at hand. It was
their aim to slip Alexander beneath the blankets,
and retreat into the cover of the pines, there to
await the startled yell that would tell them Mr.
Colby had discovered his slippery bedfellow.</p>
<p>Jake put his mouth close to Jerry&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Say,
I know I heard something&mdash;there, right back of
the tent! Somebody must be following us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of it? They can&rsquo;t see us in the
dark. All the more reason to hurry. Ready?&rdquo;
He fished Alexander forth. &ldquo;Quick, now&mdash;lift
up the covers and I&rsquo;ll chuck him in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
got no further.</p>
<p><i>Boom!</i> A thunderous explosion came from a
few feet away, and a brilliant flare lit the scene
like a flash of lightning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>With daylight clearness, the startled raiders
could see every feature of their surroundings,
standing out from the night. It was like a stage
play. The inside of Tent Fifteen was lit with a
blinding radiance. In a cleared space at the open
rear of the tent, Sherlock Jones stood, a flaming
flashlight-pan held high over his head with one
hand, his other hand clicking the shutter of the
camera, placed on a tripod and aimed straight
at the bunk over which bent the white faces of the
Utway twins. In the darkness, Sherlock had
poured more powder into the pan than would
have been necessary to light the scene of action,
and the resulting explosion had been greater than
he was prepared for.</p>
<p>Jerry jumped backward, for in the momentary
light from the pan he had seen Mr. Colby&rsquo;s eyes
open and shut again, blinded by the dazzling
glare. The boy&rsquo;s backward movement caused
him to bump his head heavily against the mooring-pole,
and he saw more stars than those that
shone in the July heavens. Alexander dropped
from his nerveless hand.</p>
<p>Jake Utway, however, was the most startled
of all those whose figures stood out in that brief
second of brightness. He could not hold in the
cry that came to his lips. Not six inches away
from his was a face&mdash;the face of a man, wild,
desperate, knotted with fear!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>For some precious seconds he was too paralyzed
to move. The flare had died down, but in
his mind&rsquo;s eye still stood forth, every feature cut
clear in his memory, the face of the stranger.
That twisted visage, he was sure, belonged to no
one of the leaders of Lenape, nor any of the
neighboring farmers that he knew. The head
was completely bald, the eyes staring from their
sockets, clenched teeth glittering between pale,
drawn lips. He knew that never, as long as he
lived, could he forget that frozen mask of terror.</p>
<p>It seemed ages before he could control his body
enough to move. Stumbling blindly beneath the
mooring-pole, he made for the shelter of the trees.
Behind him came the shrill challenge of Mr.
Colby: &ldquo;Halt! Who goes there? <i>What is it?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake ran. He had gone about twenty yards
when he tripped over a clump of brush, fell forward
perilously, crashed into the trunk of a tree.
He lay stunned where he fell. Dancing sparks
flickered before his eyes; a slow pain grew in the
left side of his face, which had smashed against
the rough bark of a pine.</p>
<p>From a few yards away came the crash of a
struggling body, tearing its way through the
bushes. &ldquo;Is that you, Jerry?&rdquo; he called
hoarsely, finding his voice and struggling to a
sitting position. There was no answer, but the
thrashing sound continued. What was it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>The unknown thing was almost upon him now.
His whole face stinging with the recent blow, he
tried to flounder to his feet. His upraised arm
came into contact with flesh! Some heavy body
fell upon his, a writhing mass of humanity. His
groping hand clutched a bony arm clothed in
some rough, thin material. At least his unknown
attacker was human! Gritting his teeth, Jake
Utway pulled himself together and grappled
with his strange antagonist.</p>
<p>The battle was brief. The enemy seemed more
bent upon escaping from Jake&rsquo;s clutch than remaining
to wrestle. It was a question which of
the two was the more frightened. Jerry found
and clung to a flailing leg until a sudden kick
sent him sprawling again. The branches of the
undergrowth crackled as the panic-stricken attacker
fought his way free.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Painfully Jake scrambled to his feet. With his
body scratched by the bushes and bruised in a
dozen places, and his face throbbing from its
blow against the tree, he now thought of nothing
but regaining his tent undiscovered. Jerry must
already have made his way back to his own tent.
Jake hoped that Mr. Avery was not among those
hurrying forms that passed near him in the dark,
hastening toward the scene of commotion; but
there was a chance that he had not been disturbed,
as the lanky councilor was known throughout the
camp as a sound sleeper who had to fight his way
to wakefulness at Reveille. Jake&rsquo;s knowledge of
the lay of the land now stood him in good stead,
and he quickly found the path and scurried
toward Tent Ten, stripping off his shirt and
sweater as he went. He breathed a sigh of relief
as he came to the step of his own tent. Nothing
seemed out of the way. His peering eyes made
sure that Mr. Avery had not stirred. With shaking
fingers Jake undressed fully, scrambled into
his pajamas, and got into the rumpled blankets
a fraction of a second before he heard steps at
the tent door.</p>
<p>The Chief&rsquo;s low voice floated through the
night. &ldquo;Taking pictures, were you? Well,
Jones, if I didn&rsquo;t know that you were a bit
cuckoo, I might wonder what you were up to.
As it is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Ch-Chief!&rdquo; Sherlock whimpered. &ldquo;If
you knew what I was taking a picture of,
you&rsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shh! Don&rsquo;t wake up the whole camp!&rdquo;
came the command. &ldquo;If you have any explanation
to make, you can save it until morning.
Now, not another word. You&rsquo;ve made enough
racket for one night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Jake could not help grinning beneath the covers.
Evidently Sherlock, impeded with his camera
and other apparatus, had not made his getaway
in time. What could the amateur detective
have been doing there at that hour? It must
have been he whom they heard following them
on their expedition. Well, time enough to worry
in the morning! He listened sleepily as Sherlock
stowed away his outfit, not dreaming that the
camera contained an exposed film which might
be a highly incriminating record of their midnight
misdoings.</p>
<p>Sherlock, however, made sure that his precious
camera was carefully placed in his locker. He
was not minded to lose his sole evidence that he
had risked all to obtain proof of the raid. He
cast a grim glance toward Jake&rsquo;s outstretched
form as he donned his pajamas for the second
time that night. Little did the brothers reck
that Sherlock Jones, the detective, had not failed!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Sherlock wakened in the morning a few minutes
before Reveille, and glanced across the tent
to see if the adventure of the night had left any
marks upon his mutinous tent-mate. It had.
The most blundering detective could not have
failed to note the clue which a tree-trunk had left
on the face of Jake Utway. His left eye was
ringed about with an inflamed patch of black-and-blue
bruises&mdash;the most gorgeous &ldquo;shiner&rdquo;
Sherlock had seen in some time. As he looked,
Jake opened the uninjured eye and glanced
achingly about him. His gaze fell on the grinning
Jones, sitting upright in his bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are all the frogs this morning?&rdquo; Sherlock
greeted him. &ldquo;Say, you ought to ask Ellick
for a chunk of beefsteak to drape over that eye of
yours. In a couple days you&rsquo;re going to have a
bee-yootiful sunset on your face. It&rsquo;s already
started to turn all colors of the rainbow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake felt his eye tenderly. &ldquo;There was some
commotion in the night, and I got up and must
have walked into something,&rdquo; he said, with due
regard for the truth. &ldquo;You better shut up,&rdquo; he
added belligerently, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t want to carry
around one just like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sherlock said nothing, but smiled to himself.
He had already decided to refer to his latest case
under the resounding title of &ldquo;The Clue of the
Black-and-Blue Eyebrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE ARM</span></h2>
<p>Sherlock&rsquo;s opportunity to learn the results
of his night&rsquo;s work did not come until
the middle of the morning. The Lenape program
gave no freedom for detective labors until the
period after squad-work had been completed.
Tent Ten had been assigned to policing the lodge,
and as Sherlock bent over his broom he cast many
a dark glance at the busy Utway brothers, fretting
until the moment came when he would be
able to take his exposed film to the dark-room and
discover the results of his snapshotting expedition.
At last Assembly sounded, and he headed
for his tent, carefully removed the film, and made
his way to the small dark-room that had been
built under the lodge for the convenience of
camper photographers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>As he shut the door, turned on the red electric
bulb, and began laying out hypo and the rest of
the developing kit, he heard voices from the
kitchen directly overhead. Ellick was superintending
the preparations for lunch, and from his
tone it was evident that his temper was not as
genial and kindly as usual. Ellick, it would
seem, had a grievance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah don&rsquo;t no-how likes to think of a thief
about de camp, Leggy,&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;Ah
gives de boys and de councilors all dey can eat.
Whaffor dey want to come stealin&rsquo; around in de
night to get bread and such?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sherlock pricked up his ears. Here was another
case for a bright detective! Stealing from
the kitchen! He awaited Leggy&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, Chef!&rdquo; the assistant answered.
&ldquo;You-all figure, maybe dey gets hongry in de
night, and a chunk o&rsquo; bread look mighty nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk foolishment! Whaffor dey have
to bust de lock on de pantry window jest &rsquo;cause
dey gets a cravin&rsquo; for a snack? And what about
de ax? Suppose dey wakes in de middle o&rsquo; de
night and gets a cravin&rsquo; to chop down a few trees?
Mah best hand-ax, stole right off de woodpile!
No suh, I don&rsquo;t like to think any Lenape fellow
goes about bustin&rsquo; into windows and swipin&rsquo; dangerous
wood-axes when folks is sleepin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;How much grub did dey-all take, Chef?&rdquo;
came a question in the voice of Howard Chisel,
the squat, bow-legged, ebony-faced lad who
presided over dishwashing operations. &ldquo;Jest
bread?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. More&rsquo;n dat. Got off wid a couple cans
o&rsquo; truck, and maybe some potatuhs. Ah declare,
if Ah don&rsquo;t tell de Chief about dis fust thing.
Hookin&rsquo; a doughnut now and den is jest boy-tricks.
Bustin&rsquo; windows and stealin&rsquo; good sharp
axes is somethin&rsquo; else again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The listening boy made a note to ask Ellick for
further details of this latest crime. At present,
he was too busy to lend his services in another
case. His hand shook slightly as he dipped the
film in the developing baths, watched with eyes
glittering behind their large lenses as the smoky
negative cleared into masses of dark and light
in the bottom of the tray. Most of the surface
was taken up with a black patch that was in all
likelihood the canvas of Tent Fifteen, but he
would have to make a clear print of the scene
before the details would show beyond question.
He hung the fixed negative to dry and went out
into the sunshine to wait impatiently until a proof
could be taken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Sherlock kicked his feet against a rock and
thought over all the information he had gathered
about the Utway affair. He hoped that the
print he was making would show without question
the full villainy of the twins. If it did not,
it would leave him in a predicament. Mr. Colby
had not seen either of the Utway twins, who had
made their ways back to their bunks without
capture. Yes; the picture <i>must</i> be a good one.
Sherlock rose and went back into the dark-room.</p>
<p>With all the skill and care of which he was
master, Sherlock Jones toiled over the developing
of the first print of the raiding scene.
Eagerly he bent over the developing bath as dark
edges began to take shape on the bit of white
paper. Slowly, slowly, the details melted into
being, seeming to spring from the waters above
the print. Now! The boy switched the print
into the fixing tray, turned on the white light,
and scrutinized his handiwork.</p>
<p>One glance, and he was ready to cry out with
disappointment. He bit his lip. The explosion
of the too-generous quantity of flashlight powder
had startled him, and in his haste, unsure of his
hearings in the darkness, he had twisted the camera
on its tripod so that none of the action was
visible. Diagonally across the picture ran the
rear flap of the tent. The head and pillow of
Mr. Colby showed with clearness, but the forms
of the Utway twins and Alexander the frog were
cut off by the expanse of the tent-fly. All that
the picture revealed was a peaceful night-scene in
one corner of Tent Fifteen&mdash;nothing more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Had Sherlock not reminded himself that a
good detective never gives way to emotion or
shows in his features the state of his feelings, he
might have stamped up and down the dark-room,
raving at his failure. As it was, he controlled
his disappointment as best he could, and patiently
went over the picture a second time, to make
sure that no detail had escaped his notice.</p>
<p>He was rewarded. In the upper corner of the
print was something which at first glance he had
not seen. It appeared to be an arm, the hand
gripping one of the tent-ropes, the upper part
near the body cut off by the edge of the negative.
With growing excitement, Sherlock drew from
his pocket the small magnifying lens he carried
with him at all times. Taking the wet print into
the outdoor sunshine, he focussed his glass on
the mysterious detail. It <i>was</i> an arm&mdash;and the
lens showed plainly a mark by which a detective
could distinguish this arm from all other arms
in the vicinity. Upon the fleshy part of the under
forearm was tattooed the sketchy design of an
American eagle with outstretched wings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Here was a clue, indeed! Sherlock quivered
with renewed hope. The arm could not belong to
Mr. Colby. Although he could not say for sure,
he had never noticed that either of the Utway
twins bore such a tattoo mark, and it was unlikely
that they could have kept secret such a distinctive
brand. Therefore they must have had with them
an unknown accomplice whom Sherlock, in the
confusion of the moment, had not caught sight
of at the time of the raid.</p>
<p>Who could it be? He thought over all the
names of the campers of Tent Fifteen. He could
remember no one who wore on his arm the patriotic
stamp of an eagle. Well, there was one
way of finding out. He could examine every arm
in camp. And this could be done quite easily
when the entire strength of the Lenape campers
gathered on the dock for swim.</p>
<p>The bugle-notes of Swim Call sounded over
his head as he hastily cleared away his developing
paraphernalia and hung the precious print to dry,
hidden in a far corner. He put away the negative
in his breast pocket and raced down to his
tent to change into swimming togs. Within a
few minutes he was on his way to the boat-dock
at the edge of the lake. He had already decided
to refer to the Utway case in the future as &ldquo;The
Clue of the Tattooed Arm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>The life-saving crew was already on duty, although
only two or three younger campers had
made their appearance on the plank floor of the
dock. As Sherlock watchfully stepped out
toward the far end, Wally Rawn, the husky
leader who directed swimming and was captain of
the life-saving organization made up of expert
leaders and older boys, was shouting to a black-haired
boy wearing the crew emblem. This boy,
Steve Link by name, was rowing a round-bottomed
steel rowboat some hundred yards out beyond
the diving-tower. Attached to the stern
painter of his craft was one of the camp canoes,
which he was towing across the water with heaving
oar-strokes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you spot her, Steve?&rdquo; Wally was
shouting.</p>
<p>Steve rested on the handles of his oars. &ldquo;Way
down almost to the dam!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;She
must have got loose last night and drifted with
the current. Had the dickens of a time finding
her, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carelessness!&rdquo; Wally Rawn muttered, shaking
his head. &ldquo;Somebody played the dub and
didn&rsquo;t even tie up after using it. I&rsquo;d think even a
tenderfoot would know that a canoe should be
brought up and turned over on the dock after a
trip. A good way to lose a fine canoe!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>He raised his arm to blow the whistle that
would begin the swimming period, and Sherlock
made sure that Wally Rawn, at least, had no
tattooed eagle on his left arm. The dock was now
crowded with campers, and the shrill call had no
sooner sounded than the air was full of diving
bodies and splashing spray as the boys of Lenape
took to water. The life-saving boats were now
at their posts, guarding the safety of the swimmers.</p>
<p>Sherlock remained on the dock, where he had a
full view of everyone. His head jerked back and
forth as he tried to follow every move of the
group of swimming boys, now grown to almost
the full number of the camp. He caught sight
of Jerry and Jake Utway, whose flying bodies
curved through the air from the highest diving-platform
and almost at the same instant cleft the
rippling surface of Lake Lenape. He watched
them moodily as they swung hand over hand
toward the farthest lifeboat. At any rate,
neither of them bore a tattooed eagle on his arm!
He must find the mysterious accomplice. With
renewed energy he swept the sportive, glistening
bodies of the gay swimmers with an intent gaze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>When the final &ldquo;All out!&rdquo; whistle blew, the
dejected Sherlock made his way up the hill. He
was baffled. His vigil had not revealed an incriminating
tattoo-mark on the arm of any of the
campers or leaders present. He must be patient
and watchful, trusting to luck and his skill at
shadowing the suspected twins to bring forth
some fresh clue.</p>
<p>As he entered Tent Ten, the only one of his
comrades before him was little shock-headed Pete
Lister, youngest and smallest lad in the tent-group.
The kid looked up as Jones came up the
step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Sherlock, look what I&rsquo;m doing!&rdquo; He
squirmed over in his seat on the unmade bunk,
and waved an indelible pencil in the air. &ldquo;See?
Making pictures, I am! Bet you never thought
of this, Sherlock!&rdquo; He stuck out one sunburnt
leg. The calf and thigh were a mass of scrawled,
deep-purple designs&mdash;crooked anchors, shaky
outlines of American flags, hearts, daggers,
skulls, and Pete&rsquo;s own name in wavering characters.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry&mdash;they come
off easy. See? First you draw &rsquo;em, then you
wet the picture a little, and I&rsquo;ll bet you couldn&rsquo;t
tell &rsquo;em from a real tattoo-mark! Want to try
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. No, thanks,&rdquo; said Sherlock Jones bitterly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IN THE NAME OF THE LAW</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; said Jake Utway. He
indicated the trampled patch of bushes.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very tree that walloped me in the
eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny I didn&rsquo;t see him when the flash went
off,&rdquo; mused Jerry. &ldquo;But I was busy, first with
banging my head on the pole, and next in getting
back home quick. What do you think he was
after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake shrugged. &ldquo;Search me! But after I
tangled with him and he got away, he made for
the path that runs down through Church Glade
to the lake. No use trying to find any footprints
now&mdash;too many of the campers have been along
since last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny, all right.&rdquo; Jerry strode back and
forth through the low brush, kicking away the
branches and examining the soft ground closely.
&ldquo;Nothing here, I guess. Let&rsquo;s go, or we&rsquo;ll have
that snooping Jones following us around again.
Hold on&mdash;what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>A bright bit of paper wrapper had caught his
eye. He lifted the object from beneath the
tangle of leaves that had concealed it from all but
the sharpest scrutiny. &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; said Jerry.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a can of condensed milk doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake looked at the small can and its bright
label. &ldquo;Funny! That&rsquo;s the same brand Ellick
uses in the kitchen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think your bald-headed friend
dropped it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; replied Jake with feeling, &ldquo;if he was
half as scared as I was, I wouldn&rsquo;t blame him for
dropping a few arms and legs! Come on&mdash;stick
that can in your pocket and let&rsquo;s stroll on. Just
like you said, that Sherlock kid is tagging after
us again. I just saw him dodge behind a tree.
He&rsquo;s been acting awful crazy ever since yesterday
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&rsquo; got a better idea,&rdquo; put in Jerry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sick of being shadowed around every minute of
the day by a goofy cluck with four eyes and no
brain! Detective, is he! Huh! We&rsquo;ll give him
something to detect.&rdquo; He set out through the
woods at a rapid gait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Jake had to take long strides
to keep up with his brother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to shadow us. All right&mdash;but he&rsquo;ll
have to go some to keep us in sight this afternoon!
We&rsquo;ll lead him a merry chase through the
woods, and by the time he gets back to camp he&rsquo;ll
be so sick of shadowing he won&rsquo;t bother us for a
month!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell! I tell you, we&rsquo;ll take him up the side
of the mountain and lose him. Bet he don&rsquo;t know
the short-cut down; and it&rsquo;ll take him until after
swim-time to find his way back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Utway twins were masters of woodcraft,
and on various hikes had explored the mountainous
country west of Lenape so that they knew
every trail and landmark. It would be no difficult
task for them to mislead the blundering
Sherlock. Jerry led the way cross-country with
an easy stride, taking care always to keep in the
sight of the amateur detective so that he would
not lose hope thus soon, give up the chase as a
bad job, and return to camp. With Jake at his
elbow, he cut through the low pines and mountain
maples beyond the Council Ring, crossed
the wagon road just below the bend, and skirting
the marshy meadows below the Hermit&rsquo;s house,
gained the base of the steep slide of boulders that
scarred the mountainside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still coming,&rdquo; Jake assured his brother.
&ldquo;I saw him a minute ago, down in that birch
swamp. He was having a heap of trouble getting
through. Wait till he hits this patch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was dangerous going now. The rock-slide
was an ancient glacial moraine, that cut fan-wise
down the face of the mountain. The two boys
crawled, leaped, and climbed from one huge,
lichen-encrusted boulder to the next, keeping a
watchful eye for lurking snakes. They made a
labored progress diagonally across the slide, now
and then covertly glancing over their shoulders
to keep watch on their victim. Sherlock, panting
heavily, had stopped to rest in the shade and
wipe away the moisture that had dripped from
his brow to cloud the lenses of his spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t come on here until we get across,&rdquo;
Jake muttered. &ldquo;We could spot him too easily,
he thinks&mdash;as if we didn&rsquo;t know every step he&rsquo;s
taken since we started! Hurry up and get into
the woods again; then we can swing around to the
short-cut and be back in camp before he gets
wise!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>In ten minutes they had left the hapless Sherlock
far behind. They were now circling around
the top of the rock-slide; far below toiled the
weary form of the detective, slipping and sliding
across the rocks. Not long after, their unerring
trailing instinct led them through the scrub-oak
of the summit and brought them out on a little-used
pathway that ran straight as an arrow from
the mountain-top down to the Lenape lodge. It
was, in fact, the line down which the water-supply
for the camp was piped, from a collecting
reservoir below the spring near the crest of the
first mountain. A track had been cut through the
woods when the pipe was first laid, and although
the way was still open, it was seldom used, most
of the campers preferring to take the road, which
made a more easy ascent. The Utway twins had
discovered the overgrown path by accident, and
now made good use of their knowledge.</p>
<p>They picked their way slowly through the
forest, following the line of leaden pipe which ran
down the hillside, now stretching for yards along
the surface, now buried a few inches beneath the
brown, needle-carpeted soil. Knowing that hiking
down a steep incline is more dangerous than
climbing, the twins, having no desire to lose any
precious camping days by being laid up with a
sprained ankle, stepped cautiously with a slow,
woodsman&rsquo;s pace. Once or twice they had to
make their way around a fallen tree trunk, and
for some distance they lost sight of the pipe-line
altogether as they gingerly circled about a
marshy bit of ground where the hillside began
sloping off above the wagon road. Deer-flies
buzzed in a cloud about their heads, and the stinging
little pests were so bothersome that both boys
hung their handkerchiefs down from their hats to
flutter in the air and keep off the humming insects.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Jerry first came in sight of the road, and broke
into a run. The road was cut in this place right
across the hill, so that it was necessary, in order
to gain it, to drop down a low cliff-edge about
the height of a man. With a glorious leap Jerry
surmounted the fringing brush and flew downward
through the air. He landed in a heap, missing
by a hair&rsquo;s breadth the body of a man who
squatted, hidden, in the shadow of the overhanging
edge.</p>
<p>Jerry cried out to warn his brother. The man
whose body he had barely missed in his blind leap
was on his feet in an instant. Jerry Utway
looked up, straight into the muzzle of a double-barrelled
shotgun aimed directly at his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo; warned the stranger in grim
tones. &ldquo;You, there, up above&mdash;hands up!
Come out of those bushes! I&rsquo;ve got you both
covered!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Jake&rsquo;s upraised hands appeared above, followed
by his face, open-mouthed with surprise.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. Come down here where I can
see you!&rdquo; There was no mistaking the urgency
of that hard voice. &ldquo;Now, you there, stay right
where you are on the ground. Not a move!&rdquo;
The man was dressed in some sort of a blue uniform.
He wore a shapeless, broad-brimmed felt
hat, and his trouser-legs were tucked into the
tops of a pair of leather leggins. &ldquo;Why, you
must be twins!&rdquo; he exclaimed in astonishment.</p>
<p>Jake slid down the slope in a cloud of dust
and a shower of gravel. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But
what&rsquo;s the idea of the hold-up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; added Jerry. &ldquo;Look
out that gun don&rsquo;t go off. You better not try
anything with us, or you&rsquo;ll have everybody in
Camp Lenape after you, Mister!&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s
bold words were somewhat belied by the shakiness
of the voice in which they were delivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, from the camp, are you?&rdquo; Slowly the
man in blue lowered his weapon. &ldquo;Anybody else
with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Hear that?&rdquo; Through the woods
drifted the familiar bugle-notes of Swim Call.
&ldquo;We got to get back for swim, or we&rsquo;ll be
missed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The stranger chuckled. &ldquo;I see. Well, guess
I won&rsquo;t keep you.&rdquo; He grounded the wicked-looking
shotgun. &ldquo;Just a word of advice to you,
buddies, before you go. Be a little more careful
how you drop on a fellow&rsquo;s neck right out of the
sky. &lsquo;Look before you leap&rsquo; is a motto that still
holds good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry rose and straightened his dusty clothing.
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I further order you, in the name of the
law, not to tell anybody at the camp that you
saw me. They&rsquo;ll learn soon enough. Now, hop
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The twins had no mind to argue with the law,
backed by a gun. They hopped it. They were
twenty yards away before the man in blue called
out to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, you haven&rsquo;t seen any strange
men around here in the last day or so, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one.&rdquo; It was Jerry who replied.
Jake caught his breath, and reflectively
felt the damaged flesh over his left eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. So long!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The twins did not speak until they had crossed
the cleared ground above the tents. As they approached
Tent Ten, Jerry broke the silence.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much for my feeble brain,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Wonder if he was after your bald-headed
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give up. Come on&mdash;we&rsquo;ll be late for swim.
Wonder where Sherlock is now? Hope he don&rsquo;t
get shot. If he don&rsquo;t turn up for supper, maybe
we&rsquo;d better go look for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within the empty tent they quickly slipped
into swimming suits and made for the dock. The
water was already alive with plunging bodies.
At the landward end of the dock, where the lake
bottom sloped gently in a sandy beach that was
a favorite spot for the younger and more timid
swimmers, who could here sport about without
getting beyond their depth, the twins paused to
watch a scene that never failed to arouse laughter.</p>
<p>Billy the Crow was taking his daily bath. Billy
was an aged black ruffian who made Lenape his
home, and was often to be seen hopping about the
tents or perching in a near-by tree, giving vent to
his feelings in no uncertain tones. At some time
in his life Billy had been caught by the hired man
on a neighboring farm, who had, by slitting his
tongue, bestowed on the rascally bird the doubtful
gift of speech. Billy knew only a few words, but
he made the most of them. This ceremony of
taking a bath at the edge of the lake was a stunt
of which Billy was especially proud. He now
teetered on a flat rock at the water&rsquo;s edge, urging
himself to overcome his timidity and bravely take
the plunge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go on in, Billy!&rdquo; said Billy with a squawk.
&ldquo;Go on in, Billy!&rdquo; With one pointed claw he
gingerly tried the water. The laughing ring of
boys about him imitated his words and splashed
the rock with water. Mr. Carrigan, camp naturalist,
sat on the planked floor of the dock, on
life-saving duty, his warning whistle dangling by
its thong in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. William Corvus Brachyrhyncos doesn&rsquo;t
seem to be fond of bathing,&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that his full name?&rdquo; Jerry Utway chuckled
as Billy finally made up his mind, and with a
last &ldquo;Go on in&mdash;aww-crk!&rdquo; doused his rumpled
feathers into the rippling waters. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s taken
enough baths to wash himself white, but he still
has to go through all that rigmarole first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crows are funny birds,&rdquo; said Mr. Carrigan.
&ldquo;He certainly is a pet around here. Ellick must
feed him crumbs from the kitchen.&rdquo; Billy finished
his brief swim-period, and fluttered across
to the dock to dry and preen himself in the sun.
&ldquo;Here he comes, shaking water all over the place.
Hello, Billy! Oh, you would, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Billy!&rdquo; mocked the bird. His bright
eye had caught sight of the dangling whistle, its
metal bowl twinkling as the sun&rsquo;s rays caught it.
A few hops took him to the councilor&rsquo;s side. A
sharp beak caught at the thong, tried to drag the
whistle from its owner&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natural-born thieves, crows,&rdquo; said Mr. Carrigan.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll steal anything that happens to
catch their eye. Here, let go, Billy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy, insulted, uttered a final scolding squawk
and flew noisily to a perch on a near-by tree.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">BRAVES IN COUNCIL</span></h2>
<p>First Call for supper had already sounded
before Sherlock Jones returned to camp. He
limped into Tent Ten weary, scratched, and footsore,
and in a dejected mood. It was a thankless
task for a detective to try to shadow a pair of
expert woodsmen through the mountains. He
had barely time to wash his face and comb his
rumpled hair before the camp was called to stand
Retreat at the regular sundown ceremony of lowering
the flag. His thoughts, as the buglers
played To the Colors, were not friendly toward
the two spruce, innocent-looking brothers who
stood stiffly to attention at his side. It was beginning
to look as though Sherlock Jones, the
great detective, was baffled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>After the evening meal, Lieutenant Eames, officer
of the day, announced that Indian Council
would convene that night at the usual summons.
Twilight found the braves assembling for the
pow-wow. Figures of boys and leaders, draped
each in his blanket, trooped solemnly toward the
Council Ring on the north side of the campus. A
hush fell upon the circle of listening tent-tribes as
they awaited the call that was always, by long
tradition, the signal for the ceremony to begin.</p>
<p>Through the hush of the dusk came the soft,
whistling call of the first whippoorwill. Answer
came from a near-by thicket. Amid the liquid
chorus the Chief rose from his seat, pulled his
blanket about him, and spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Braves and sagamores of the Lenape tribe,
you have been gathered in council by the call of
the whippoorwill. Brave Sunfish will now light
the friendship fire in Indian fashion, with rubbing
sticks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Sunfish Linder stepped forth from his tent-group,
and took his place on the windward side of
the fire, laid four-square in the center of the ring
to supply light rather than heat. He put one foot
on the cedar hearth-stick of his outfit, twisted the
thong of the bow about the spindle and placed the
drilling-point into the point of the notched hearth-stick.
Holding the drill steady at the top with
a soaped drill-stone in his cupped hand, he began
sawing the bow back and forth, at first slowly,
then with increasing speed. Friction of wood
upon wood caused a trickle of hot, powdery
splinters to drop into the tinder-pan. A few seconds
of rapid action, and the pan held a glowing
coal of powder, which was dumped upon the prepared
tinder. Sunfish swayed the bunch of tinder
back and forth in his cupped hands, breathed
upon it slightly. The glowing mass burst into a
golden flame. The firemaker thrust the blaze
between the logs. As it caught, climbing yellow
tongues licked upward through the pile, and the
friendship fire was alight. The silent campers
broke the spell with a chorus of approval in Indian-talk.
&ldquo;How, how!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good medicine! May the spirit of the Great
Manitou watch over and guide our councils as
we gather in peace this night,&rdquo; said the Chief, and
sat again upon his stone dais.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>The Utway twins never failed to enjoy the
council in the woods. Something there is in the
heart of every boy and man which only finds itself
when a close-knit band of their brethren gather
together in friendship beneath the star-sprinkled
lodge of the great outdoors. The two boys sat
with one blanket thrown over their sturdy shoulders,
looking about the circle of faces thrown
into bold relief by the ruddy glare of the fire.
The tent flares were now lit, each small fire glowing
in its brazier at the end of a pole marked with
the tent totem. The great totem pole of Lenape
towered above the huddled groups on the south
side of the fireplace, its carved and painted emblems
glaring forth awesomely from time to time
as a shower of sparks flew upward. Opposite, on
the north side, was the stone seat of the Chief,
with its tall back of silvery birch trunks, shaped in
the form of a gigantic &ldquo;L&rdquo; standing out from the
blood-red blanket that curtained the majestic
dais. The fine-cut head of the Chief rose above
his blankets, calm, powerful, serene. At his side
sat Sagamore &ldquo;Happy Face&rdquo; Frayne, Lenape
scribe and keeper of the birch-bark scroll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are now ready to hear the report of scouts
of the Lenape tribe,&rdquo; announced the Chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>This was the time for any member of the group,
if he wished, to rise, bespeak the attention of the
Chief and the assembled braves, and relate the
discovery of anything which might be of interest
to the tribe. Mr. Carrigan, now recognized under
the title of &ldquo;Sagamore Wise-Tongue&rdquo; because
of his wide knowledge of nature-lore, rose
and after addressing the Chief, reported that he
had seen a covey of spotted snipe, and that the
braves newly come to camp would soon have the
rare chance to hunt these nimble birds with bag
and lantern. Brave Rolfe rose to ask the name
of the constellation of stars now riding overhead,
and Brave Slater of Tent Four was called upon
by the Chief to give a short talk on the signs now
visible in the summer sky. Small Brave Barstow
reported that the kingfisher&rsquo;s nest he had found
by the lakeside now contained four little fledglings.
The report of each scout was greeted with
the approving murmur of &ldquo;How!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the Chief rose, to open the period of reports
for the welfare of the tribe. This was the
time for campers to tell of any observation which
they had made which might lead to the improvement
of the camp in any way&mdash;to point out steps
that might be taken to keep the routine orderly
and effective, or offer to help build or repair camp
equipment. Instantly Steve Link was on his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Chief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, Brave Link.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;This morning before swim I found that the
Red Fox canoe was missing from the dock. I
took out a boat and finally found the lost canoe
far down at the end of the lake, drifting with its
paddles on the bottom. I questioned the braves
of Tent Eleven, who had used it when they went
out after supper last night, and they said that
they had left it bottom-up on the dock when they
returned. Someone else must have been responsible
for this carelessness. Now, every brave
knows that such a canoe as the Red Fox is valuable
and must be treated with care. I would like
to ask that every brave who has passed his canoe-test
consider himself duty bound to make sure
that our boats and canoes are treated as they
should be treated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, how!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine suggestion, Brave Link. Sagamore
Happy Face will enter it on the birch-bark scroll.
Now&rdquo;&mdash;the Chief&rsquo;s face was serious in the firelight&mdash;&ldquo;now,
I must say something which I have
never, in my years as Chief of Lenape, had to say
before. There is a stain on the name of the tribe.
I dislike to say this, but&mdash;there is a thief among
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thief!&rdquo; A babble of voices came from the
ring of braves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on the Chief grimly; &ldquo;someone
among us here to-night&mdash;unless I am gravely mistaken,
which I hope I am&mdash;someone here has no
right to share the free and honest councils of our
tribe.&rdquo; With an outstretched hand he silenced
the rising flood of questions. &ldquo;I will tell you
what has happened, and you may judge for yourselves.
Several days ago Brave Tompkins took
off his gold ring to wash his hands, down by his
tent. When he looked for it a few minutes after,
it had disappeared, although he saw nobody near
him at the time. When he told me about it, I
thought he might have lost it himself, and advised
him to wait and see if it turned up. But
to-day, when Sagamore War-Canoe Munson told
me that his silver wrist-watch had vanished under
somewhat the same circumstances, I began to
think that there must be a false brave among us,
with light fingers and a spotted heart. Then, this
morning our faithful Ellick came to me with the
story of a robbery in the kitchen during the
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh, ugh!&rdquo; growled disapproving voices
from the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, bad medicine,&rdquo; went on the speaker.
&ldquo;Ellick reports that the lock of the pantry window
was broken and a supply of food taken away.
Moreover, he says that a large hand-ax is missing
from its place on the woodpile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Utway twins listened breathlessly as the
Chief went on. Sherlock Jones stirred eagerly
within the folds of his blanket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;One word more, and I will not bring up this
unpleasant subject again to-night. Some one of
you must know or guess who is guilty of these
strange disappearances. If anyone here comes
to me and returns these lost articles, and makes a
clean breast of his misconduct, none of the braves
shall know of his trespass against the Lenape
code. Are there further reports for the welfare
of the tribe? If not, we will pass to the less serious
part of our council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ranked listeners relaxed, and there was a
laughing, expectant hum of voices as &ldquo;Guffy&rdquo;
Evans rose to challenge all comers to a talk-fest.
The challenge was immediately accepted, in the
name of Tent Ten, by Sagamore Avery, who
therewith entered little Lefkowitz as their champion
in this jabbering contest. Sagamore Happy
Face announced the subject: &ldquo;Give a two-minute
speech on Why Polar Bears Don&rsquo;t Wear Red
Flannel Underwear,&rdquo; and gave the contestants
thirty seconds to prepare their arguments. At
the command, the two opponents faced each other
near the center of the ring, and began a high-pitched,
nonsensical stream of chatter about
nothing in particular. Lefkowitz was finally
shouted into speechlessness, and the victorious
Guffy took his seat amid cheers and cat-calls,
while Soapy Mullins rose and called upon Lefty
Reardon, the baseball captain, to stand against
him in a hand-wrestling tilt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>After a series of boisterous games of &ldquo;Buzz,&rdquo;
the fun was concluded by a short ghost story
from Sax McNulty, which sent shivers of horror
chasing up and down the spines of the younger
campers. At last the Chief rose and held out his
arms in Benediction above the dying fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the spirit of the all-seeing Manitou go
with every brave as he leaves his place at our
council this night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flashlights pointed out the path as the drowsy
braves filed toward their tent homes. The
Utway twins, although pleasantly tired from
their active day in the open, were nevertheless
wakeful and alert. Behind them came the low
chatter of a pair of youngsters from Tent Seven.</p>
<p>Jerry caught a phrase dropped by one of them,
a small lad named Toots. &ldquo;Gee, I clean forgot
to make my report of scouts. You remember,
Al, that when we saw that smoke from the woods
across the lake, I said I&rsquo;d report it at council?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Jerry questioned him. &ldquo;You
saw smoke across the lake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy eagerly, &ldquo;me and Al here,
we were out in a rowboat over that way, and saw
some smoke coming up like somebody had a
campfire in the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm. Take my advice and don&rsquo;t say anything
about it. Not worth mentioning.&rdquo; But
Jerry looked at Jake, who nodded back. The
expanse of heavily-wooded land across the lake
was almost always deserted, so much so that deer
tracks were often to be discovered within its
depths. A campfire there was certainly a most
unusual thing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">NEWS AND MORE NEWS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Jerry!&rdquo; said Jake Utway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go up and pitch down the chunks,
and the other guys can stow them away in the
refrigerator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on!&rdquo; answered his brother, and began
climbing the ladder.</p>
<p>Tent Ten had been assigned, as their squad-work
the next morning after the council, to filling
the large refrigerator in the pantry behind
Ellick&rsquo;s large, airy kitchen. This duty required
that they ascend to the towerlike structure that
housed the summer&rsquo;s supply of ice for Camp
Lenape. In mid-winter, when the lake was
sheeted over with a crystal mass some six inches
thick, a gang of men always came with saws and
teams of horses to harvest the ice and store it, between
layers of sawdust, in the Lenape ice-house
for the use of the campers the following season.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>It was the plan of the brothers to enter the ice-house,
dig out the embedded blocks required, and
send these down the chute to their waiting tent-mates,
whose job it would be to wash away the
sawdust and transport the ice to Ellick&rsquo;s gaping
refrigerator. Armed with ice-tongs and a large
miner&rsquo;s pick, Jake and Jerry climbed to the
upper door of the edifice, and entered its chill
gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, work fast, if you don&rsquo;t want to
freeze!&rdquo; advised Jerry. He raised the pick and
began clearing away the thick crust of sawdust
in one corner of the place, but paused as his
brother made no move to aid him. &ldquo;Hey! Earn
your keep, man! Don&rsquo;t stand star-gazing all
morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake was staring upward. The ice-house was
solidly built, but at one corner of the roof the
sunlight slanted through a narrow crevice. The
watcher had for an instant seen that spot of light
cut off by the passage of a small body. Jake
pointed. &ldquo;Something up there, Jerry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s eyes were more accustomed to the darkness.
&ldquo;Why, you cluck, that&rsquo;s only Billy the
crow! Hello, Billy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Billy!&rdquo; the cackling echo drifted
down from the roof. &ldquo;Billy the crow!
Awr-rck!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;He probably lives up there,&rdquo; went on Jerry
in a matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;Now, are we going
to finish this job, or do I have to do it alone?
Come out of your trance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly Jake took his eyes from aloft, scraped
away the sawdust with his foot, and clutched the
half-revealed cake of ice with his tongs. &ldquo;Fire
away! But I got an idea, Jerry&mdash;and as soon as
we chuck enough ice down, I&rsquo;m going to try it
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys worked swiftly and silently after
this, panting and shivering slightly as they uncovered
one slab of ice after another and sent
them crashing down the chute, after a shouted
warning to their toiling comrades on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, guess that&rsquo;ll hold Ellick for a while,&rdquo;
said Jerry at last, resting from his labors.
&ldquo;Now, what&rsquo;s this bright idea of yours, Jake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy&rsquo;s still up there,&rdquo; answered his brother.
&ldquo;I often wondered where his nest was. Crows,
as Sagamore Carrigan said down at the dock
yesterday afternoon, are funny birds. If you
give me a boost on your shoulders, I think I can
climb up the side of the wall the rest of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what good that&rsquo;ll do you,&rdquo; said
Jerry promptly, &ldquo;but here goes!&rdquo; He cupped
his hands, and Jake scrambled athletically to his
shoulders, bracing his body against the rough
timbered side of the building. Jerry grunted.
&ldquo;Uhh! Say, Jakie, you ought to be a sailor for
this job! Sailors are experts when it comes to
climbing to crow&rsquo;s nests!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy ruffled his feathers and cast a beady, suspicious
eye down upon these proceedings.
&ldquo;Aww-rk!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Billy the crow! Go
on in, Billy!&rdquo; With a series of angry squawks
he edged through the narrow opening in the roof
and flew away to more interesting scenes.</p>
<p>Jake was by this time clinging to the wall, far
above the sawdust surface where Jerry stood,
head bent back, watching the climber&rsquo;s progress.
Cautiously, arms spread eagled to seize any projection
no matter how small, Jake ascended precariously
toward his goal. He was now within
arm&rsquo;s length of the corner where the talkative
crow had made his entrance. Motes of dust
danced in the beam of sunlight over his shoulder,
and his groping hand stirred up a mass of dust
and cobwebs which made him sneeze. In a far
corner, on a ledge of rafters, his fingers touched
a hard, metallic object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you slip now,&rdquo; called Jerry warningly,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll get another black eye to match the first
one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Jake grinned with satisfaction as the sunlight
glittered on the thing he held in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crows are funny birds,&rdquo; he remarked a
second time. &ldquo;Natural-born thieves. Here,
catch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry ducked, and deftly snatched the shining
circle which came spinning down at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admiral Munson&rsquo;s wrist-watch,&rdquo; announced
Jake. &ldquo;And Terry Tompkins&rsquo; ring is here too,
along with a lot of other junk.&rdquo; He was stuffing
the nondescript collection of articles into his
pockets as he spoke. As cautiously as he had
come, he began descending from his lofty perch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So <i>this</i> is what you found in the crow&rsquo;s
nest!&rdquo; said Jerry, and whistled. &ldquo;Jakie, you&rsquo;re
brighter than I thought you were. You put two
and two together, and get&mdash;a heap of assorted
jewelry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crows are very fond of bright objects, and
will steal them and carry them off to hide away,
if they get a chance,&rdquo; explained Jake with condescension,
leaping at last to the sawdust floor.
&ldquo;Yep, Billy was the thief. Look here!&rdquo; He
drew out his treasure-trove. In his hand, in addition
to young Tompkins&rsquo; gold ring, lay a bit of
crumpled tinfoil, the rusted top of a pickle-jar,
a silver dime, a few bent nails, and the brass
button from a scout uniform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; breathed Jerry in mock admiration.
&ldquo;Say, you didn&rsquo;t see Ellick&rsquo;s hand-ax
up there, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a sap. Come along&mdash;we&rsquo;ll show the
Chief he was wrong about thinking there was a
thief among the campers. Bet he&rsquo;ll be tickled to
find that the thief wears feathers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One after the other they slid down the ladder
to the ground. Sherlock Jones and Wild Willie
Sanders were wrestling with a large slab of sawdust-covered
ice; they looked up curiously as the
twins raced by them, on their way to the Chief&rsquo;s
office in one corner of the lodge.</p>
<p>As they stampeded across the mess hall to the
small room that served the camp director as an
office, they found another visitor ahead of them.
The Utway twins almost fell over backward as
they recognized the blue uniform and leather
leggins of the man who held the door-knob, calling
a parting sentence to the Chief standing
within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you fellows see or hear anything of him,
just get to the nearest phone and call up the
prison. They&rsquo;ll know how to get in touch with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>It was the man whom they had stumbled upon
at the wagon road, who had held them up at the
point of a gun! The gun was in the crook of his
right arm now, as he turned and caught sight of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello, twins! Jumped on anybody&rsquo;s
neck lately?&rdquo; he asked in a hearty voice, clapping
on his felt hat and striding toward the door of
the lodge. &ldquo;So long. Be good boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake stared at Jerry in wonderment, and Jerry
stared back. Who was this stranger, whom they
had first encountered in the woods? They were
aroused by the voice of the Chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, boys. What have you there,
Jake?&rdquo; The Chief was the only person in camp
who was always sure which brother was which.
He had from long acquaintance discovered that
Jerry had a tiny mole almost concealed under
the bronze-colored hair that fell over his left
temple, which mark served to distinguish him
from his twin.</p>
<p>Jake stammered out his tale. As the Chief
listened, his forehead knit into a puzzled frown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;So it was Billy all the time, eh?&rdquo; he said as
Jake finished. &ldquo;You were pretty clever to
figure that out. I&rsquo;m glad to hear that these
things are safe, and I&rsquo;m sure Terry Tompkins
and Mr. Munson will be, too. But that makes the
kitchen robbery all the more strange. With what
we know now, it&rsquo;s impossible to connect the loss
of these things with the person who broke into
the food-supply the other night. There&rsquo;s still a
thief loose around Lenape, boys, and for some
minutes now I&rsquo;ve had the feeling that I know
who it is.&rdquo; He placed Billy&rsquo;s plunder on his
desk, and sat down thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Jerry summoned up courage. &ldquo;Excuse me,
Chief&mdash;but who was that man that just left here?
Jake and I saw him guarding the road yesterday
afternoon. What&rsquo;s he carrying a gun around
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief spun about in his chair and faced
them. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s looking for a thief, too,&rdquo; he said
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; both boys cried in unison.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t tell you,
I guess&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have to make an announcement
about it to everybody at lunch to-day. Boys,
there&rsquo;s a dangerous man loose in this part of the
country. Last Saturday night a convict escaped
from the state prison up beyond Elmville. He
had some hours&rsquo; start before he was found missing.
The warden thought it likely that he would
head over this way, toward the mountains, where
he might hide in the woods for days and never be
found. Guards were sent out, but so far there&rsquo;s
been no sign of him. The man you just saw is
one of the prison guards, who is watching over
this way. He tells me the escaped prisoner is a
man named Burk, serving a term of several years&mdash;for
robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robbery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you can see why I thought until now
that this prisoner might be in the neighborhood
and might have stolen this watch and ring. It&rsquo;s
too bad the prison people didn&rsquo;t warn me before
now&mdash;no telling what might have happened in
the meantime. However, now we have been
warned, and will be on our guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did&mdash;did you tell the prisoner-keeper&mdash;the
fellow who was just here&mdash;that somebody broke
into the pantry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Jerry. He seemed to think it
might be an important clue, and is getting a crew
of men together to search the woods around the
camp more carefully. You see, there&rsquo;s a reward
offered for the capture of this criminal, and
naturally everybody is eager to earn it. Now, be
careful and don&rsquo;t get very far away from the
campus unless you have a councilor along, boys!
An escaped convict is a mighty dangerous customer.
And don&rsquo;t say anything about what I&rsquo;ve
told you until after lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>The Utway twins stared at each other again as
the door of the office closed behind them. Jerry
seized Jake&rsquo;s arm in an excited grip. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t you tell the Chief about the man you saw
down by Fifteen the other night?&rdquo; he whispered
urgently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have a chance. Besides, why should
we give that prison guard all the glory of capturing
the convict?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE DISAPPEARING ACT</span></h2>
<p>The Chief&rsquo;s announcement that an escaped
convict was in their neighborhood fell like
a bombshell in the midst of the campers assembled
at lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All boys are forbidden to go out of sight of
camp, unless a councilor is along,&rdquo; he ended.
&ldquo;We must take precautions until this dangerous
man is captured. Now, to-night we will assemble
here in the lodge, for Stunt Night. Every tent-group
will be expected to have an act or other
stunt prepared, and prizes will go to the winners.
Dismissed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The groups scattered from the mess-hall to
their respective tents to pass the daily siesta hour
which was set aside as a period of rest and quiet
from the brisk, noisy turmoil of the camp&rsquo;s
activity. Mr. Jim Avery cocked his long legs up
on the end of his bunk in Tent Ten. &ldquo;We have
the whole afternoon to get ready,&rdquo; he observed
to his followers. &ldquo;That should give us plenty
of time to work up a first-class stunt that will
bring home the prize. Anybody got any ideas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wild Willie Sanders spoke up. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
an edge on the other tents, haven&rsquo;t we? Here we
are with Chink Towner, the most famous Mandarin
Magician in captivity. Say, I&rsquo;ll bet we can
put over a magic show that will knock the rest
of the tents silly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Chink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chink Towner agreed
modestly. &ldquo;We could do it, all right. I&rsquo;ve got
a lot of new tricks up my sleeve that nobody ever
saw before. The best one, though, needs to have
Jerry Utway, and that means we&rsquo;d have to take
Tent Eight into partnership with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can be arranged, I think,&rdquo; said Mr.
Avery. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to Dr. Cannon about it. He
knows it&rsquo;s next to impossible to separate the
twins. And with fourteen campers on the job, it
ought to be some show. Well, what&rsquo;s your
trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what is it?&rdquo; asked the Utway twins
together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; began the Mandarin
Magician; &ldquo;Wild Willie can announce a big display
of old Chinese hocus-pocus. We fix up a
place on the stage where I sit, and a crowd of
you guys come around and want to see some
tricks. Then Fat Crampton comes along, and
then I do a few easy ones, just to show my stuff,
and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He lowered his voice as his comrades
gathered about to hear the plan. Lefkowitz
was sent over to Tent Eight to bring in the other
participants, who listened and agreed to the
scheme for a combined stunt that would make a
most amusing addition to the vaudeville program
that night. As soon as Recall sounded, the two
groups of actors made for the Council Ring,
where they rehearsed excitedly most of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Sherlock Jones did not join in the preparations
for Stunt Night. He retired alone to the dark-room,
where he stared at a photograph and pondered
plans of his own. The announcement that
a reward had been offered for the capture of the
escaped criminal had set his mind working furiously
on the problem of the Tattooed Arm. Indeed,
the Chief&rsquo;s startling news was a leading
topic of conversation in Lenape that afternoon;
but when supper-time brought no further information,
the subject was temporarily forgotten in
anticipation of the evening&rsquo;s entertainment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>No sooner had the dessert dishes been cleared
away than the space in front of the blackened
fireplace was transformed into a stage. Benches
were ranged in rows for the seating of the camper
audience, and a makeshift curtain of bed-sheets
strung on a wire was hung across that end of the
lodge. Darkness had just fallen when a boisterous
crowd of leaders and boys took their seats,
awaiting the drawing of the curtain on the opening
act, announced by Sax McNulty, master of
ceremonies, as &ldquo;Captain Colby&rsquo;s Army,&rdquo; a Tent
Fifteen Feature Production.</p>
<p>Joey Fellowes, who with his brother Ted made
up the Lenape bugle corps, sounded Reveille on
his muted instrument. The curtains parted to reveal
a morning scene in Tent Fifteen. A great
fuss was made by Ollie Steffins, dressed in a
scout uniform with many medals and much gold
braid, who in the person of Mr. Colby himself,
went about getting the snoring sleepers to waken
for morning drill. The drowsy boys were finally
put on their feet and each armed with a broom-stick
gun, with which they went through a series
of clumsy maneuvers, knocking each other over
the head, facing the wrong way, and otherwise
tangling themselves in a travesty of a squad of
rookies at drill. The concluding evolution
brought them into line facing the audience, singing
off key their rallying song:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>We are Mr. Colby&rsquo;s army,</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>Mr. Colby&rsquo;s army we,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>We cannot shoot, we won&rsquo;t salute,</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>What earthly good are we?</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The curtains closed amid cheers, boos, and stamping
of feet, during which Mr. Colby sat with a
self-conscious smile on his disciplinarian&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The acts followed swiftly after that. Tent
Twelve put on a pirate play, Tent Three showed
to advantage in a lady-like game of basketball,
in which each side begged the other to kindly accept
the ball on pain of being slapped on the
wrist. Tent Four gave a ventriloquist act, with
Peanut Westover as the talking dummy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Mysterious Mandarin Magician,&rdquo; with
an all-star cast from Tents Eight and Ten, was
the next to the last number on the evening&rsquo;s program.
At the parting of the curtain, Wild Willie
Sanders in a high, battered black silk hat,
wearing the curling mustache of a circus ringmaster,
pointed out the main attraction to a gaping
crowd of boys from the participating tents,
dressed in wild garbs of every description.
&ldquo;Laydeez and gen-tul-men! The <i>one</i> and <i>only</i>
Chinese magician, brought at great expense from
the Flowery Kingdom to mystify you to-night!&rdquo;
Chink Towner, his naturally oriental cast of
countenance exaggerated by a line of grease-paint
above each slanting eye, and dressed in a
pair of colorful silk pajamas borrowed from
Councilor Lane, sat cross-legged above the crowd
on a blanket-draped table, his features masked in
Chinese calm. &ldquo;Step right up, laydeez and gen-tul-men,
and see the <i>one</i> and <i>only</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fat Crampton, tittering sweetly, walked by,
dressed as a beautiful damsel in a skirt fashioned
from Howard Chisel&rsquo;s spare kitchen apron. The
Mysterious Mandarin descended from his throne
and expertly drew half-dollars from the hat,
sleeve, and nose of the &ldquo;lady.&rdquo; He then gave an
exhibition of sleight-of-hand, at which he was an
adept of no mean skill&mdash;making a collection of
red balls appear and disappear between his nimble
fingers, shaking a flying pack of cards from
his fan, collecting the cards in a neat pile and
drawing forth at one flip the card desired by any
of the nondescript crowd about him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>When he returned to his elevated throne once
more, Wild Willie announced that the Mandarin
would now display the powers of his X-ray eye.
Chink turned his back to the audience, and
Happy Face Frayne, one of the judges who
would later award the prizes for the best performance
of the night, adjusted a bandage over
the magician&rsquo;s eyes to make sure there was no
deception. Jake Utway now walked out into the
ranks of the audience, and touched a sweater
worn by one of the listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the color of the object I am touching,
Mandarin?&rdquo; he called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue,&rdquo; answered the blindfolded Chink
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct. Now what color am I touching?&rdquo;
Jake held up Soapy Mullins&rsquo; neckerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; answered Jake, putting Slim
Yerkes&rsquo; sailor hat back on the astonished boy&rsquo;s
head. All about him were faces wonder-stricken
at the accuracy of the magician&rsquo;s responses.
Jake, however, was not astonished, for he was
in on the secret. The series of colors had been
arranged with Chink ahead of time, and all Jake
had to do was to find and point to an object of
the required hue. &ldquo;And now, what is the color
of the thing I&rsquo;m pointing at?&rdquo; He held a finger
to his damaged left eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rainbow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>A hearty laugh arose, for Jake&rsquo;s &ldquo;shiner&rdquo; had
indeed developed the color of a sunset, and was
by now one of the sights of the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;I bet you my life I can do that, too!&rdquo;
broke in Spaghetti Megaro of Tent Eight, now
assuming his role in the show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Jake, returning to the
stage.</p>
<p>From his capacious bathrobe, Spaghetti drew
forth a spreading assortment of vegetables.
&ldquo;Now, Mandarin,&rdquo; he said loudly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to see if you cheat me, huh? Tell me quick&mdash;what
color is this spinach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what color is this lemon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right again. Now, I ask you, what color
is this orange?&rdquo; The Italian boy held the fruit
high in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty smart, all right.&rdquo; Spaghetti shook his
head and began eating the orange. &ldquo;No can
foola da majish&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This bit of comedy was greeted with high
amusement by the audience. Again Wild Willie
stepped forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Laydeez and gen-tul-men, the Mysterious
Magician will end his exhibition with a death-defying
display of his great powers. Never
before has this breath-taking miracle been performed
on any stage! The Mandarin will make
a person vanish, and then make him appear again
somewhere else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words were Jake&rsquo;s cue to move again.
He glanced quickly overhead, and made sure that
Jerry was in his place, ready for the disappearing
act that would give a climax to their stunts. He
was rewarded by a nod from Jerry, who sat
perched on the rafters high above the floor of
the lodge and the rows of watchers in the camp
audience. This was Chink&rsquo;s great idea&mdash;a disappearing
act in which the twins would take part.
Jake, dressed in his camp uniform, would be selected
from the crowd to enter a large packing-box
on the stage, and at Chink&rsquo;s command, a
flashlight would be thrown aloft, and Jerry
dressed in a like costume, would swing down from
his high position and drop to the stage and there,
his hidden twin&rsquo;s exact counterpart, would receive
the applause due to this miraculous reappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wishes to disappear into thin air, laydeez
and gen-tul-men?&rdquo; cried out Wild Willie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>A chorus of voices rose on the stage, Jake&rsquo;s
among them. &ldquo;I do!&rdquo; &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, take
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo; Wild Willie, according to plan,
pointed out Jake, who stepped forward. &ldquo;You
will now enter this large chest. No deception,
folks!&rdquo; The boy in the high silk hat lifted the
box to show that there were no false bottoms or
secret exits. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Pretty soon you&rsquo;ll
disappear, and come back from somewhere else.
Now, step inside, and you&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed to Fat
Crampton&mdash;&ldquo;you sit on the lid. All set, Mandarin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chink again descended to the level of the stage,
his blindfold now removed. Calmly and impressively
he took his hands from his sleeves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heap hard trick!&rdquo; the magician grunted.
&ldquo;Make &rsquo;um white boy no-see, plitty soon come-see
some place else, velly smart!&rdquo; He waved his
arms over the box, upon which Fat Crampton
sat. &ldquo;Hocus-pocus. Come <i>high</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The audience was bent forward in silence.
Jake, crouched within the narrow darkness of
the box, pictured to himself the scene outside.
At the magic words, a flashlight would shoot upward
toward the rafters where Jerry had taken
his station, and Jerry would drop to the stage
and finish the act amid the plaudits of the crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hocus-pocus. Come <i>high</i>!&rdquo; repeated Chink,
in a nervous tone. Jake wished he could see out
of his tight prison, and wondered at the delay.
Titters came from the smaller boys in the front
of the audience. Why didn&rsquo;t Jerry come down?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come <i>high</i>!&rdquo; Chink sounded disgruntled.
&ldquo;Maybe so white boy no come, no can fly out.
That&rsquo;s all&mdash;goo&rsquo;-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rings of the curtain rattled as they were
drawn together to cut off the scene. The big
act had failed. There was a half-hearted clapping
from the audience, who of course did not
see any point in the sudden ending of the act.
With such an anti-climax, the Magician sketch
could scarcely hope to win a prize.</p>
<p>Jake squirmed in a frantic effort to get out of
the box. &ldquo;Get up, Fat!&rdquo; he called urgently,
and felt the heavy boy&rsquo;s weight removed from the
lid. Jake sprang out like a Jack-in-the box,
alive with eagerness to see why their carefully-laid
scheme had fallen through. He met a disgusted
look from the grease-painted face of the
Mysterious Mandarin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine brother you&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo; muttered Chink.
&ldquo;I thought he was going to be all ready up there
when the time came!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but he was!&rdquo; stammered Jake. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
saw him up there just a minute ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s not there now,&rdquo; Chink growled,
turning away. Jake cast his eyes aloft.</p>
<p>The beam of a flashlight still slanted upward
toward the raftered corner under the roof. But
Jerry Utway was nowhere in sight!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">OFF FOR PEBBLE BEACH</span></h2>
<p>Where was Jerry?</p>
<p>Boys from Tent Four were crowding on
the stage, getting the scene ready for the next
act. Jake Utway stood stock-still, gazing at the
rafters overhead, where his brother had been a
moment since. He could not have descended into
the lodge unobserved in the short time Jake had
spent in his dark box. Why hadn&rsquo;t he taken his
cue and dropped to the stage at Chink&rsquo;s summons?
It was not like Jerry to do a thing like
that. There must be some good reason&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Jake went over in his mind the plan they had
made for this &ldquo;disappearing act&rdquo; which had
turned out to be a disappearance in real earnest.
Jerry was not to go on the stage with the others
for the first part of the magic show. He was to
get the long ladder, climb silently to the roof
of the lodge porch, and then cautiously crawl
through the open window in the far gable of the
building&mdash;&mdash;That was it! The window! Why
hadn&rsquo;t he thought of that before? Jake rushed
through the bunch of amateur actors dressing in
the Chief&rsquo;s office, and emerged on the lodge
porch. A ladder leaned against the building, but
even in the dim light he could see that Jerry was
not on the ladder.</p>
<p>He was aware of a voice at his elbow. &ldquo;Looking
for something?&rdquo; It was Sherlock Jones, who
had followed him from the lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry! He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; Jake blurted. &ldquo;He
must have crawled out the window again, and
gone off somewhere. Why didn&rsquo;t he tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look for clues&mdash;that&rsquo;s the thing to do in a
case like this,&rdquo; advised Sherlock with a business-like
air. &ldquo;He must have climbed down the ladder.
Come on.&rdquo; The two boys ran around to
the steps, and presently Sherlock snapped on his
flashlight at the base of the ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No footprints can show up on this rocky
ground,&rdquo; observed the detective. Jake glanced
wildly at the surrounding trees and bushes, as if
determined to make them give up their secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo; he shouted desperately. &ldquo;<i>Jerry!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>There was no answer. Sherlock flickered his
electric torch here and there about the scene of
action. &ldquo;No, sir, not a thing&mdash;&mdash; Wait,
though! What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; He caught the glint of
metal about fifty yards in the direction of the
tents, and ran toward it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&rdquo; proved to be a large-size can of tomatoes.
A few paces down the hill was a similar
can, and another of beans. Sherlock held them
up for inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clues! Jake, do you know where these came
from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake groaned. It was as he feared. Even now
Jerry might be wrestling in the darkness with a
deadly foe, or lying senseless in the woods, struck
down by a blow from behind&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find
him! Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Above them, from the lighted lodge, streamed
out a blare of music from the Lenape band. Pale
stars glimmered overhead in the warm summer
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; asked Sherlock calmly.</p>
<p>Jake made no answer, but stumbled down the
hillside, making to the left, where he remembered
he had lost sight of his antagonist the night of
the raid on Tent Fifteen. Then, the man had
headed for the lake, and it was probable that
under the same conditions he would again do
likewise. It was a slim chance, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Their footsteps guided by the yellow splash of
brightness from the flashlight, the two boys broke
through the campus and into the stretch of woods
beyond. It seemed to Jake, as he raced through
the night, that hours had passed since he was released
from the box to find Jerry missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much chance&mdash;find anybody in these
woods,&rdquo; panted Sherlock, holding his side.
&ldquo;Stop a second, Jake&mdash;give me time to get my
breath&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here, then, if you&rsquo;re winded,&rdquo; answered
Jake fiercely. &ldquo;Here, lend me the light, and
I&rsquo;ll come back for you. I tell you, I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to
find him!&rdquo; Before the other could protest, he
seized the flash and was on his way toward the
lake&rsquo;s rim at a breakneck speed.</p>
<p>He was now almost to the rustic bridge that
cut across the stream through the marsh at the
head of the lake. Water shone glassily through
the trees at his right hand. A huddled form
loomed ahead in the path beyond the bridge,
showing ghostly in the pale beam of the lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Jake?&rdquo; came his brother&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter? Are you all
right?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Jerry rose and limped toward him.
&ldquo;I heard voices up the hill, and thought it might
be you. Who&rsquo;s with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left that Jones kid up there&mdash;he got a
stitch in his side. But are you sure you&rsquo;re not
hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got off into the marsh, and banged into
some birch trees, that&rsquo;s all. To-night it seems to
be my turn to chase around in the dark and bump
into things. But I&rsquo;m sure sorry I spoiled the
act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, now I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re safe,&rdquo;
answered Jake with relief. &ldquo;You saw him&mdash;the
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear as daylight. I happened to be looking
out the little window in the top of the lodge,
just about the time you got into the box, and I
saw him sneaking down from the kitchen. He
must have been prowling around again, looking
for something to eat, and thought it was a good
time to break in, when everybody was watching
the show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you went after him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;There was just a chance to nab him&mdash;that&rsquo;s
why I didn&rsquo;t yell out and get the whole camp on
his trail. He might have got clean away by that
time. Besides, we didn&rsquo;t want to miss the reward,
did we?&rdquo; Jerry rubbed his bruised arm, which
had suffered when his untimely fall had put an
end to the chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure he was the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have been anyone else, Jakie. But
he spotted me when I was coming down the ladder,
and dropped his stuff and ran. I followed
him down about to here, and then I slipped on
some muddy rocks and lost him. But we know
where to find him if we want him, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shh!&rdquo; Jake said warningly. &ldquo;Here comes
Dopey Sherlock. Don&rsquo;t say a word&mdash;he&rsquo;s suspicious
enough already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doughty detective had at last found his
breath, and came stumbling toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you found him, did you?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;What was he doing down here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just taking a walk, Sherlock old boy,&rdquo; said
Jerry easily. &ldquo;Anything else you&rsquo;d like to
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;a whole lot. Did you drop some cans
of tomatoes and stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they were just part of the show. If you&rsquo;d
been at the rehearsal this afternoon, instead of
moping around by yourself, you&rsquo;d know all about
these things. Now, which would you rather do;&rdquo;&mdash;Jake&rsquo;s
tone was threatening&mdash;&ldquo;shut up, or get
a sock on that long nose of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Sherlock glanced timidly about him, and retreated
a few steps. He knew that he was no
match for the two Utway twins; and here in the
darkness, far from the campers and protecting
leaders, it would be unwise to arouse their ire.</p>
<p class="tb">Morning brought further news of the search
for the escaped prisoner. The Chief announced
that a band of volunteers, under the direction
of prison guards, had made a prolonged search
of the vicinity, but had found no traces of the
missing criminal. The object of their search had
been free for more than four days now, and it
was thought by some that he might have gotten
clear away and escaped unseen to a far city where
he could go undetected for some time. However,
it was best not to relax the precautions they had
made; and therefore the plans for tent hikes that
night would have to be changed. A storm of protest
greeted these last words, for the campers
dearly liked the fun that always came when each
tent, under its leader, took its supper and made
an evening&rsquo;s camp in some favorite spot a few
miles from their usual haunts on the campus.
But the Chief was obdurate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>At lunch, the Chief rose and stated that so
many boys had come to him to ask that his ban
on the tent hikes be lifted, that he had decided
to allow these hikes to take place after all. He
silenced the cheering with a lifted hand, and
added that no group should camp more than a
mile away from the lodge, and all should be in
their own tents by ten o&rsquo;clock at the latest.</p>
<p>This was good news. Noisy discussions took
place at each table, as to what spot should be
selected as the site of their evening meal. Jerry
Utway shouted down the others at Dr. Cannon&rsquo;s
table, and finally got them to lay claim to Pebble
Beach, a narrow bit of ground on the northeast
border of the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with Jerry&rsquo;s gang, please!&rdquo; requested
Jake. Mr. Avery, who had decided to
take Tent Ten no farther away than Church
Glade, gave a ready consent; and so it was arranged.</p>
<p>Directly the afternoon swim was over, the
campers dressed in their hiking outfits, and two
boys were sent to draw each tent&rsquo;s rations from
the kitchen. Jake and Jerry Utway, burdened
with pans full of beans, raw potatoes, bread, salt,
butter, and other provisions, headed for the dock,
where two rowboats, filled with the remaining
boys of Tent Eight, waited to shove off for their
short journey across to Pebble Beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much like the look of the sky,&rdquo; observed
Dr. Cannon, sitting in the stern of one
of the boats as the boys stowed away the provisions.
&ldquo;But I guess we&rsquo;ll be all right. Everybody
got his poncho or raincoat? If it starts to
rain, we can get back to the dock in short order.
Ready? Shove off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boats, manned by a husky youngster
at each oar, drew away from the dock, and shot
across the placid water in the direction of their
chosen camping-ground. Thus calmly and unsuspectingly,
Jake and Jerry Utway, at the oars
of the foremost boat, embarked upon the wildest
night of their lives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE MAN IN BLUE AGAIN</span></h2>
<p>The two boats grated on the shingle of
Pebble Beach, and their gay crews disembarked
and moored their craft to trees overhanging
the water. Boys ran in all directions, fetching
dry wood to the circle of blackened stones that
marked the site of many a Lenape bivouac, and
potatoes, in their jackets of damp clay, were
thrust into the first embers of the small cooking
fire that had been lighted under Dr. Cannon&rsquo;s
direction.</p>
<p>While the supper they had brought was cooking,
Spaghetti Megaro organized a game of
&ldquo;duck-on-a-rock.&rdquo; Twilight brought a gang of
ravenous campers in a cluster about the fire,
watching with alert eyes the drawing forth of
the food whose steaming aroma, mingled with
the bitter tang of wood-smoke, made every mouth
water. The sun faded out into a gray foggy
mass of clouds low-lying over the Lenape range
across the lake, and by the replenished fire&rsquo;s glow,
the boys squatted about and ate their simple
meal, spicing it with many a cheery quip and
good-natured jest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>When pans and mess-kits had been washed by
the simple method of rubbing dirt on their surfaces
to remove the grease, afterward dipping
them in the lake, dead limbs and brush were
heaped on the fire, and in the circle of light sent
forth by the jolly blaze, the boys of Tent Eight
settled themselves for an evening of campfire
talk.</p>
<p>One story followed another, most of them having
to do with strange occurrences, haunted
houses, ghosts whose touch made the victim&rsquo;s
hair turn White in a single night. As the hours
passed, the air about the little encampment became
decidedly spooky. A wailing wind had
arisen, and swept mournfully through the overhanging
trees. Down the lake on the other side,
a leaping torch of flame marked the spot where
Tent Two, camped below the baseball field, had
built a high fire that danced with every gust and
spouted a hail of sparks toward the murky sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Oscar Hansen, a freckle-faced blonde boy, was
relating the tale of the Golden Hand. He raised
his voice as the climax of his story drew near.
&ldquo;&mdash;And he heard a footstep outside the door
of the room, and a scary voice said: &lsquo;<i>Who&rsquo;s got
my Golden Hand?</i>&rsquo; Then he heard the door
swing open, and something said, in a louder
voice: &lsquo;<i>Who&rsquo;s got my Golden Hand?</i>&rsquo; But he
couldn&rsquo;t see anything there. His hair stood on
end. He sat up in bed. The thing was right at
the foot of his bed, saying in an awful screech:
&lsquo;<i>Who&rsquo;s got</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody jumped, and little Barstow cried
out in fear. A dislodged stone rolled down into
the fireplace. Peering eyes made out the towering
form of a stranger just beyond the circle of
firelight. A man had come upon them unawares
as the group sat absorbed in the ghostly tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope I don&rsquo;t interrupt your fun. But I saw
the fire, and just thought I&rsquo;d step over and warm
my hands a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Cannon rose to greet the newcomer.
&ldquo;Glad to have you. We were telling ghost
stories, and I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo; startled us a bit,
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diker. I&rsquo;m from the state penitentiary over
beyond Elmville.&rdquo; The stranger shook hands,
and pulled aside his slicker for a moment; the red
glow flashed on the metal of an official badge.
&ldquo;Glad to know you, sir. Well, if it isn&rsquo;t my
friends the twins!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Jerry stuck his elbow in Jake&rsquo;s ribs. It was
the man in blue again! The prison guard! Now
that they looked closely, they could see that what
they had first taken for a stick in the man&rsquo;s hand
was in reality the gun which he never seemed to
be without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, boys. I&rsquo;m just staying a minute,&rdquo; the
guard went on. &ldquo;A warm fire feels mighty good.
I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we had a good-sized
storm before morning. You&rsquo;re lucky you don&rsquo;t
have to prowl around here in the dark all night,
the way I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, have a seat,&rdquo; said Dr. Cannon hospitably.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still after that prisoner who
got loose, I suppose. Are there any further
developments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such luck. He&rsquo;s disappeared completely;
but sooner or later, he&rsquo;ll be starved out of the
hole where he&rsquo;s hiding, and then we&rsquo;ll get him
again. It won&rsquo;t be an easy job in these woods,
though, because Burk&mdash;that&rsquo;s the man&rsquo;s name&mdash;used
to be a hunter&rsquo;s guide and is a real woodsman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a fellow is he? Any objection
to telling us?&rdquo; asked the doctor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; said Diker cheerfully. &ldquo;From
what I&rsquo;ve seen Of him, Burk is not a bad chap.
Short, slender fellow&mdash;always quiet and well-behaved,
never gave any trouble, until last Saturday
morning, when he was discovered missing.
We still can&rsquo;t figure out how he got away from
the prison grounds. It was a foolish thing for
him to do, too; he only had a year more to serve,
and now, when he&rsquo;s caught, it will mean added
time for breaking prison.&rdquo; Diker held out his
hands thoughtfully over the fire. &ldquo;As I say, he
was a guide for hunters&mdash;he knows the Lenape
hills about as well as anybody&mdash;and most of the
year he was caretaker at the Canoe Mountain
Sportsman&rsquo;s Club, down below Wallistown.
Well, he was caught stealing money or jewelry
or something when he was there alone, in charge
of the place&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I ever rightly heard
the exact circumstances. Probably some temptation
came his way, and he wasn&rsquo;t strong-willed
enough to resist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t sound like a very dangerous character,&rdquo;
remarked the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not a fighter&mdash;but any man in a
corner will fight for his liberty when he has to
do it. I wish we could get him soon, though&mdash;I&rsquo;m
a bit tired of hiking through the country day
and night in all sorts of weather. If we could
only spot the smoke of his fire, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; burst out Al Canning, nerving himself
to speak. &ldquo;Say, Mr. Diker&mdash;you said something
about smoke. Me and another kid named
Toots saw some smoke over here a couple days
ago, right on this very side of the lake! Down
below a ways where the trees are thickest&mdash;we
saw it from a boat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; The prison guard bent a sharp glance
on the flushed face of the youngster. &ldquo;Well,
there&rsquo;s a chance he may be in there. If nothing
else happens, I&rsquo;ll take a bunch of deputies in
there first thing to-morrow, and if he&rsquo;s there,
we&rsquo;ll get him! But say, young fellow, if you saw
this smoke several days ago, why didn&rsquo;t you report
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; stammered Al, &ldquo;me and Toots were
going to tell it at Council Ring, but we forgot,
and one of the Utway kids here said it wasn&rsquo;t
worth mentioning.&rdquo; He pointed to the twins,
and stopped, breathless.</p>
<p>Jake and Jerry faced the accusing glance of
the guard. &ldquo;Hmm! I seem to run into you two
wherever I go. Now, will you kindly tell
me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A crashing blast of thunder broke in upon his
words, and a jagged stab of lightning illuminated
the sky. Dr. Cannon jumped up hastily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;Back to camp, boys!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Put
out the fire, stow everything in the boats, and
head for the dock! Everybody put on his raincoat&mdash;the
storm will be here before we know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rising wind whipped a few stinging drops
against their faces as he spoke. The prison guard
stood motionless amid the bustle of breaking
camp. In a few moments the little beach was
crowded with the campers, who loaded their kits
into the boats and climbed in after them. The
fire hissed as Linder poured a bucket of water
over the embers.</p>
<p>The return journey across to the dock was
short, yet in that space of time the storm broke in
fury. Stiff, white-crested waves slapped against
the thwarts, and made smooth progress with the
oars a difficult feat. Jake and Jerry bent their
backs with a will, and their round-bottomed steel
craft was the first to reach the dock. As the
other two occupants clambered out, with water
steaming from their rubber ponchos, Jerry
caught his brother&rsquo;s arm and drew him under
the shelter of the diving platform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew, that was a close one!&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;That guard is sure suspicious of us&mdash;I could
see it in his eye. And he means what he says. A
gang of men can go over that patch of woods
across the lake with a fine-tooth comb, and they&rsquo;ll
find our convict as sure as shooting. This is our
only chance to get the reward&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have to do
it to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m game!&rdquo; Jake brushed the raindrops
from his hair with a swift motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get undressed. As soon as everybody
is asleep, crawl out and meet me by the flagpole.
Wear your poncho, and bring your big flashlight.&rdquo;
A rumble of thunder capped his words. &ldquo;Jakie,
we&rsquo;ve got to do it! We&rsquo;ve got to find our
man, and bring him back!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE LAIR OF THE ENEMY</span></h2>
<p>Jerry Utway lay in his bunk, fully
dressed, for about an hour after Taps had
summoned the campers to slumber. The storm
had settled to a steady drumming torrent that
would probably persist far into the next day.
The sides of the tents had been lowered and fastened
to the floor by their grommets, to afford
the fullest protection from the blast. An occasional
flash of lightning, accompanied by a crack
of booming thunder, lit up the familiar tent at
intervals. Jerry shivered slightly as he stretched
out in his blankets and listened to the furious
tattoo of drops on the tent-fly over his head. He
would have liked a less tempestuous night for
their expedition, but dawn would put an end
to their hopes unless they moved speedily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>At last he judged it safe to make his getaway,
and with infinite patience crawled into his boots
and poncho, and shielding his flashlight, crept
out into the night. The vicinity of the campus
was black as pitch. Jerry felt his way through
dripping underbrush, in order to avoid disturbing
any sleeper. He found Jake by the flagpole, and
without a word the two brothers stumbled down
to the boat-dock.</p>
<p>On the unprotected platform of the dock they
felt upon their wet faces the full power of the
storm. Wicked-sounding waves swirled through
the piles on which the dock was built; the little
fleet of rowboats rocked and pounded each other
at their moorings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put on your light,&rdquo; cautioned Jake
hoarsely. &ldquo;That prison guard may still be patrolling
over across, and if he happened to spot
us, the game would be over. We&rsquo;ll have to take
a boat&mdash;we couldn&rsquo;t get a canoe launched in this
water to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You untie a boat and pull it around in the
lee of the dock, while I get the oars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments Jerry returned with the
precious oars, and they were shoved into the locks
of the boat Jake had selected. Before putting
off, it was necessary to bail out the pool of rain-water
that splashed in the bottom of the craft,
and this Jake did, using his sou&rsquo;-wester hat as
a bail. When the duckboards beneath their feet
no longer floated, the brothers cast off, seized the
oars, and headed about on their second crossing
that night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Head straight across!&rdquo; ordered Jerry. &ldquo;I
figure that if we keep right into the teeth of the
wind, we&rsquo;ll come out at that pile of logs straight
across, where the deer-trail comes down to the
lake. Heave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keeping the full sweep of the wind at their
straining backs, the twins worked the oars with
a heaving, united swing. Spray dashed over the
bows and drenched their rubber garments; the
rolling boat pitched and dived as they met one
white-capped wave after another, head on. The
dim structure of the diving-tower and the shore
beyond faded swiftly into the gloom; but after
fifteen minutes of labor they had no other evidence
that their craft had made any progress in
the direction they wished to take.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quit!&rdquo; grunted Jake. &ldquo;Heave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several times the bows were swept around and
they took water broadside over the low gunwale
before a frantic effort on the part of one or the
other could swing them on their course again. It
seemed to both laboring boys that hours had
passed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Bump! The stem of the small vessel crashed
against some unseen obstruction, nearly throwing
the young mariners headlong on to the floor-boards.
Both clung to their oars, and a wave
lifted the boat from its precarious position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We rammed the top of a sunken log!&rdquo; called
Jerry, who was nearest the bow. &ldquo;I think it may
be part of that big jam we headed for. Any idea
where we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I remember, the deer-trail is down to the
right a few hundred yards. What do you say we
skim along offshore and try to find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Boy, I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s over!&rdquo; Jerry
was breathing heavily from his exertions. He
pulled on his oar, shoved off from the dark mass
of piled logs an arm&rsquo;s length away, and the boat
began skirting the dimly-seen shoreline.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>They had made the crossing in a Stygian darkness,
but now the thunder again commenced its
ominous cannonade. An opportune bolt of
heaven-sent fire gave them a momentary glimpse
of the shore on their port side, and told them
what they wanted to know. Jake made out the
muddy delta where, he remembered from a previous
visit, the deer-trail began. Before the
gloom closed in again, he pulled about and began
stroking madly toward this landing. A thought
struck him like a chill hand. Had a pair of terrified
eyes spotted their boat from the black shelter
of the trees? Did a desperate evil-doer lurk
there, armed with Ellick&rsquo;s sharpest hand-ax,
waiting for them to set foot on shore&mdash;&mdash;? Jake
shrugged. The rowboat buried its nose squashily
in the mud-bank, beneath the dripping trunk of
an overhanging tree.</p>
<p>Without a sound the boys moored the painter
to a convenient branch, and cautiously removed
the oars and placed them beneath the thwarts,
along the bottom of the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to bail her again before we go
back&mdash;if we do go back,&rdquo; whispered Jerry grimly.
&ldquo;Can you get ashore from where you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo; Jake stood and clasped the slippery
tree trunk with both arms, and swung his
body forward. His heavy boots made him a
clumsy climber; but in a moment he had scrambled
through a fringing litter of brush and twigs
to firmer ground. Jerry followed in his track,
almost dropping his flashlight as he clambered
through the treacherous brush; and the boys
found themselves once more together in the darkness
of the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stick to the trail&mdash;it&rsquo;s our only guide,&rdquo; advised
Jake. He led the way, recalling as best
he could the twisting of the narrow track which
they had once followed by daylight on an idle
exploring trip earlier in the season. An infrequent
lightning-flash was their only help, and it
was no wonder that they more than once wandered
from the dim trail.</p>
<p>Deep into the murky reaches of the woods,
they paused for breath. So far, they had seen
or heard nothing save gloom-shrouded trees; the
usual storm-noises of the wilderness; and the
crackling of branches that marked their advance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, which way?&rdquo; asked Jerry guardedly.
&ldquo;I think the trail splits about here. It&rsquo;s getting
late&mdash;if anybody in our tents wakes up, we&rsquo;re
sure to be missed. No use waiting here.&rdquo; His
teeth were chattering from the damp of the low
ground. &ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;ll have to give up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake was staring intently ahead. &ldquo;I thought
I caught a little glow of light over there just a
second ago! If this rain would only hold up for
a while&mdash;&mdash; There! See it?&rdquo; He seized his
brother&rsquo;s arm and pointed.</p>
<p>Jerry peered anxiously into the mist.
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that way! Right ahead! It must be a
fire! That&rsquo;s our man, all right! Guess he thinks
he&rsquo;s fairly safe on a night like this&mdash;and he sure
needs a fire; it&rsquo;s chilly enough over here to freeze
you stiff! Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Jakie! No use trying to creep up on
him, though. We&rsquo;ll sneak as close as we can, and
then both rush him and jump him together!
Come on, let&rsquo;s get it over with. He&rsquo;s not much
bigger than we are, and we&rsquo;ll take him by surprise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him get hold of his ax, though!&rdquo;
Jake quivered with excitement. &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; He
crept toward the low tinge of red light that
marked the outlaw&rsquo;s risky campfire.</p>
<p>They advanced unchallenged for some two
hundred yards through the dripping trees, in
line with their goal. Their straining eyes could
barely make out a small heap of glowing branches
at the mouth of what seemed to be a rude shelter
of sticks and dead limbs, which would cut off the
tiny glow from all other directions except the one
from which they approached. Not another sign
of life came from the secret camp they had risked
so much to find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; said Jake sharply, and dashed forward.
Jerry was right at his side in a few
strides. It was like the football days at school,
with Quarterback Jake carrying the ball, and
his husky brother at his elbow, crashing through
the line&mdash;&ldquo;Right through center!&rdquo; Jerry was
amazed to hear that shout in his own voice. In
the madness of that charge he had sent forth the
old battle-cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Together the Utway twins galloped down
upon their foe. From an opening in the shelter
beyond the fire appeared a pale, haggard face; a
slender body sprang forward to meet this surprise
attack; a shrill scream burst from the drawn
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Stand back!</i> You&rsquo;ll never take me&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Involuntarily the twins slowed up in their
tracks. A streak of lightning, like the crack of
doom, hit the earth at a terrifyingly short distance
away. The scene was illuminated as if by a
thousand searchlights. Their enemy, the searing
mark of horror branded on his face, cried out
once more. His frail body quivered as if from
a blow, toppled weakly forward, and lay in a
heap almost at their feet&mdash;face forward, helpless,
deathly still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A DARING RESOLVE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s fainted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake and Jerry stared in bewilderment
at the inert body at their feet. Their first thought
was not one of triumph at this successful ending
to their quest. Rather, it was one of pity for the
tortured man whose desperate break for liberty
had availed him nothing. Jerry was stirred to
action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him into the lean-to! The poor fellow
can&rsquo;t hurt us now. Quick!&rdquo; The twins lifted
the limp form and carried him gently into the
low brush shelter that he had built for protection
against the elements. The rude thatched roof
held off the rain fairly well, and both boys removed
their ponchos, laying one on the ground,
placing their unconscious burden upon it, and
covering the convict&rsquo;s body with the other. Jerry
pulled open the rough gray shirt at the man&rsquo;s
throat, and fanned the bloodless face with his
hat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get some water, Jake! I think the creek
is only a few steps away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake departed. His brother snapped on his
flashlight, and cast its beams full upon his captive&rsquo;s
face. The man was not bald, as Jake had
thought when he had first encountered him; his
hair had been shaved close to the top of his head,
but now a bristling stubble had grown to cover
it. The chin and jowls were also darkened with
a rough growth of beard showing blackly against
the pallid face. Through bluish lips, the breath
came in quick sobs. The man&rsquo;s body, under the
close-drawn poncho, was slender and wiry, and
although but slightly taller than one of the twins,
gave the impression of some strength.</p>
<p>Jake returned with his sou&rsquo;-wester half full of
water. He splattered a few drops over the prisoner&rsquo;s
face, and forced a slight trickle down the
man&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t choke him!&rdquo; cautioned Jerry. &ldquo;Here,
I&rsquo;ll rub his arms and chest. He&rsquo;s cold, and no
wonder! Think of staying in this place for several
days, without any blankets or even a coat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began rubbing the man&rsquo;s limbs briskly, and
noted a flush of returning color in the pale
features.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to bring him around,&rdquo; observed
Jake. &ldquo;Say, he doesn&rsquo;t look much like a desperado,
does he? Poor fellow, it&rsquo;s a shame he has
to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shh!&rdquo; Jerry paused, and tucked the protecting
poncho about the body again. He had
seen an eyelid flicker in the light of their lamp.
The convict moaned feebly, opened his eyes,
closed them again as the light struck them.
&ldquo;Give him a little more water, Jakie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly their patient revived. His body jerked
weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; said Jake soothingly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to sit up. Can you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man fell back wearily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never&mdash;take
me&mdash;<i>there</i>&mdash;again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he murmured
faintly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;water&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are. That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; Jake propped
him up, and held a handful of water to his mouth.
&ldquo;Shade the light, Jerry. What do you think
we ought to do with him now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s half frozen. We&rsquo;ll have to get him
warm.&rdquo; Jerry had meanwhile noted a small pile
of wood heaped under the eaves of the narrow
shelter, at the side of which lay the small ax which
Ellick had missed after the raid on his kitchen.
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t matter now if anybody sees the fire.&rdquo;
Leaving his place at the man&rsquo;s side, he stirred up
the dying flames and placed a few more sticks
upon them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s stopped raining for a while, I
think. We&rsquo;ll bring him over here, where he can
get warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skillfully they brought their prisoner, still
wrapped in the poncho, to a sitting position at
the mouth of the lean-to, close to the reviving fire.
The man&rsquo;s breath was coming more easily now.
His eyes were open, and he watched their every
move, without attempting to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of it, Jake,&rdquo; Jerry went on; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
been in the woods now for four or five days, without
any decent clothes, and only a little food to
eat, scared every minute that he will be caught
again. It&rsquo;s no wonder he&rsquo;s worn out.&rdquo; He
turned to the man. &ldquo;When did you eat last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The one addressed shook his head. &ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t
know. Last night&mdash;got some food&mdash;dropped
it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Stunt Night!&rdquo; put in Jake.
&ldquo;Sherlock and I found some cans of tomatoes he
dropped when you chased him. Say, if we only
had&mdash;&mdash; By jiminy, I just thought!&rdquo; He
reached in his breast pocket. &ldquo;I got a couple
bars of chocolate to eat to-night on the picnic,
and just remembered them now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>The paper-wrapped candy he drew out was
sodden and melted by contact with his body, but
the man&rsquo;s eyes fastened themselves on them with
mute pleading as Jake tore away the tinfoil about
the sticky mass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;help yourself. Don&rsquo;t eat it too fast,
though, or it may make you sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With shaking fingers, their starving captive
seized the proffered food, and wolfed it ravenously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash; You boys are all right. Guess
it&rsquo;s no use. But&mdash;how did you find me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re from Camp Lenape, across the lake.
We&rsquo;ve seen you before,&rdquo; answered Jake; &ldquo;once
when I ran into you the time that crazy Sherlock
Jones shot off his flashlight powder down by
Tent Fifteen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man nodded. &ldquo;I got some food over
there. I remember. I tried to find some clothes
in a tent, but a big light went off, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;And you tangled up with me in the
woods,&rdquo; finished the boy. &ldquo;Guess we were both
pretty scared. Then, last night, Jerry here
spotted you, coming down from the
kitchen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who I am?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Burk. But say,
you don&rsquo;t look much like a thief and a jailbird.
What did you do it for? I mean, how did you
get in trouble in the first place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smouldering fury came into Burk&rsquo;s eyes.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Do you hear me?
I&rsquo;m not guilty! And for more than a year I&rsquo;ve
been penned up in that place&mdash;like an animal&mdash;an
innocent man!&rdquo; His voice had risen to a high
scream which echoed through the dripping darkness
of the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! You mean you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man fell back, exhausted by his short outburst.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect you to believe me,&rdquo; he
said wearily. &ldquo;Nobody believed me. Nobody.
But it&rsquo;s true. There was a mistake, and everything
was against me. Guess they were justified&mdash;I
couldn&rsquo;t prove I didn&rsquo;t take the necklace.
The evidence was too strong&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What necklace?&rdquo; asked Jake with interest.
&ldquo;They said you stole a necklace somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother him now, Jake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Burk sat up again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo; The
warmth of the fire and the food they had given
him seemed to have bestowed fresh energy. &ldquo;I
want to tell you, even if you don&rsquo;t believe me. If
I had been able to get away this time, I think I
could have proved my innocence, but it was no
use. But you boys, whoever you are, have been
decent to me, and I want you to know I wouldn&rsquo;t
lie to you. By the way, what are your names?
I&rsquo;d like to know. Brothers, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twins. I&rsquo;m Jerry Utway, and this is Jake.
But what about the necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both boys had forgotten that they sat in the
wet woods in the dead of night, far from their
friends, who might miss them at any moment.
They were intent only on hearing the story of
this strange man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was about a year ago,&rdquo; began Burk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
always spent most of my time in these mountains&mdash;my
father was a hunting guide, and I became
one, too, after I went through high school. I had
a pretty good job as steward and caretaker of a
place down on Canoe Mountain, west of Wallistown.
It was a sort of hunting lodge, belonging
to a club of sportsmen. I lived in the lodge all
year round, and took out parties of deer-hunters
and fishermen during the season. Well, at this
particular time there was only one man staying
at the lodge&mdash;a man named Collinge, a banker
in the city. He was going out fishing that afternoon
by himself, and asked me to take care of an
expensive pearl necklace he had brought up with
him. His daughter was driving up next day with
some friends&mdash;it was her birthday, and he was
giving her the necklace as a present. A party
was planned, and I had to get things ready. As
it happened, I had a touch of &rsquo;flu at the time&mdash;I
didn&rsquo;t say anything about it, as I thought it
was just a bit of a cold, but I must have had a
high fever that day. I took the necklace. He
told me to guard it carefully, as it was quite valuable.
That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what happened?&rdquo; prompted Jake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What happened!</i>&rdquo; repeated Burk in despair.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the question I&rsquo;ve been asking myself a
hundred times a day, back yonder in the prison.&rdquo;
He shivered. &ldquo;Mr. Collinge came back that
evening and found me lying on my bed, raving
with fever. The necklace was nowhere in sight. I
couldn&rsquo;t tell him a thing&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t remember
what I had done with it; I&rsquo;d been out of my head
most of the time. Well, I don&rsquo;t much blame him
for getting angry and thinking I had hidden it,
stolen it to sell later. He gave me until morning
to produce the necklace or take the consequences
of being a thief. When morning came, I was
better&mdash;but no matter how I hunted all over the
place, I couldn&rsquo;t find the necklace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you couldn&rsquo;t remember?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was gone&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. I was innocent&mdash;but
how could I prove it? At the trial, Mr. Collinge
was decent enough, even if he had lost a
great deal of money; he asked the judge to deal
with me leniently. But naturally everybody
thought I had yielded to temptation, and was refusing
to confess. Once in a thousand times, a
jury will convict an innocent man. This was the
one unlucky time. I went behind the bars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burk stared at the flickering fire for several
minutes, lost in unspeakable thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, don&rsquo;t ever do anything that might lead
to a prison cell. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash; Well, never
mind that. I stood it, and I must stand it again,
now you&rsquo;ve caught me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you going?&rdquo; asked Jerry curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you? I&rsquo;ve had a feeling, all the
time I was in jail, that if I could only get back
to the Canoe Mountain Lodge, I might be able
to&mdash;to find the necklace and prove I wasn&rsquo;t
guilty. I had a feeling I might remember&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s eyes were alive with enthusiasm.
&ldquo;You think if you got to the lodge, it might all
come back to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I hoped. As far as I know, the
necklace was never found. If that&rsquo;s true, it must
still be there. If I could only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Jakie?&rdquo; Jerry Utway
looked over at Jake, who nodded back.</p>
<p>The convict stared from one to the other.
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry jumped up, pounding his fist in his
palm. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give you your chance&mdash;Jake and
I will help you prove you&rsquo;re not a thief! No
matter what happens, you&rsquo;re going back to Canoe
Mountain and try to find that necklace! And
we&mdash;we&rsquo;ll go with you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TRUNK ROOM</span></h2>
<p>The astonishing proposal of the twins took
the man completely aback. He turned his
head away. A choking rose in his throat, and he
rubbed his eyes with the back of one hand.
&ldquo;Boys&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He swallowed several times before
he could go on. &ldquo;Boys, nobody&rsquo;s ever had as
much faith in me as you two are giving&mdash;&mdash; No
use trying to tell you what it means to me, or trying
to thank you&mdash;&mdash; But I couldn&rsquo;t ask you to
do it. Any help you give me will put you in
reach of the law. No, I couldn&rsquo;t do it. The
game&rsquo;s up, and I&rsquo;ll just have to make up my mind
to go back&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, that&rsquo;s no way to talk!&rdquo; put in Jerry
with assumed roughness. &ldquo;Now, forget everything,
except that from now on, we&rsquo;re going to
do all we can to make you a free man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>The twins were glowing at the prospect of new
and more daring adventure. To protect Burk, to
risk everything in a dash across country, in order
to prove him guiltless of the crime for which he
was condemned&mdash;here was a deed the thought of
which set their hearts beating wildly!</p>
<p>Jake outlined their campaign. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
travel until you&rsquo;re fed and rested, Mr. Burk.
And you can&rsquo;t stay here&mdash;the prison guards will
be through here in a few hours. We&rsquo;ll have to
hide you, somewhere near camp, where you can
rest up for a while. To-morrow night we&rsquo;ll start!
Just leave everything to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trunk room!&rdquo; Jerry burst out. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the place! Nobody ever goes in there&mdash;he can
sleep all day to-morrow, and even the police
wouldn&rsquo;t think of looking right in the camp
lodge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea, Jerry. Now, if you think you
can move, Mr. Burk, we&rsquo;ll start. Here it&rsquo;s raining
again, which is good&mdash;it&rsquo;ll wash out our
tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys helped the dazed man to his feet, and
Jerry hung his poncho over his new friend&rsquo;s
shoulders before helping Jake to try and remove
all traces of the little camp in the woods. The
small fire was soon buried in mud and brush; the
lean-to was pushed over and pulled apart, and the
branches scattered as far as possible. Taking the
ax, Jake led the way back along the muddy trail
to the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>The little party found the shore of the lake
without mishap, and pushed off through a steady
drizzle. Burk seemed lost in a daze. Only once
did he speak on the return journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you say something, back there,
about a reward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; the boy whispered. &ldquo;You must have
guessed they would offer some money for your
capture. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ll have to keep you out
of sight all the time, until you find that necklace.
Now, better not talk any more&mdash;that prison
guard might spot us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The campus was undisturbed; no light showed
anywhere through the rain. It was probable that
the twins had not been missed, and stood a good
chance of returning to their bunks undetected.
Both boys were busily planning their new adventure,
and first and foremost in their thoughts
was the safety and comfort of the man they had
promised to aid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Between the pillars supporting the downhill
end of the lodge, a loosely-boarded structure had
been built next to the dark-room. This large
space was used for storing the trunks, suitcases,
and warbags which had served to transport the
outfits of the campers from their homes. The
trunk room was seldom entered during the season.
Jerry&rsquo;s idea of hiding Burk in this place,
directly beneath the feet of the campers as they
assembled for meals, was not in reality such a
dangerous scheme. Unless he took to the open
woods again, there was no other place on the
Lenape campus which afforded such secrecy and
protection. All the man had to do was to lie
here snugly, resting and regaining his strength,
and unless he made a suspicious noise, he might
go undiscovered for some time.</p>
<p>Jake pushed the door open a crack and tiptoed
softly inside. The others entered behind him,
and Jerry snapped on his light. Their shadows
stretched gigantically across the rough floor and
scaled the heaps of piled trunks and suitcases.
Dry, warm, protected, and seldom entered, here
was a good refuge for the outlaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hear anybody coming, you can hide
behind a pile of trunks,&rdquo; pointed out Jerry.
&ldquo;You can easily stay here until to-morrow night.
Jakie, you see if you can make him comfortable.
I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Jerry left them, and went to the kitchen. His
hunch was a good one. On one of the tables he
located a pile of pans and dishes which had been
brought in by the late-returning hikers that evening.
His guarded flashlight revealed that much
unused food had also been returned. He found
a pan half full of beans, an untouched loaf of
bread, some butter and jam, and a can of pineapple
which he opened before returning with his
trove to the trunk room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;This will hold you
down for a while, Mr. Burk. We&rsquo;ll try to bring
more to-morrow, if we can do it safely. In the
meantime you can be having a long sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found a good place,&rdquo; said Jake. He
pointed to a far corner of the room, where an
old, patched canvas, the remains of a worn-out
tent, was folded to form a rough bed. Burk wore
Jake&rsquo;s sweater over his wet garments. The man
had seized eagerly upon the food, and was stowing
it away in short order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These boards may not be the softest bed in
the world, but at any rate, it&rsquo;s better than the wet
ground on a night like this,&rdquo; Jake went on. &ldquo;I
guess you&rsquo;ll be able to sleep. But be careful not
to stir around too much. All day to-morrow, until
taps, there will be at least a dozen fellows
around within a few feet of this place. And to-morrow
night, when everybody&rsquo;s asleep, we&rsquo;ll
come and get you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;And to-morrow, some time, we&rsquo;ll smuggle in
some decent clothes, and a razor, and everything,&rdquo;
added Jerry. &ldquo;Anything else you
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burk, his mouth full of food, shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, good night! And to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys went to the door. Burk rose and
ran to them, seized their hands. His voice shook,
and he made no effort to hold back the tears that
welled in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, boys&mdash;and God bless you! God
bless you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">When Sherlock Jones awoke in the cold, gray
morning, a few minutes before Reveille, he had
a feeling that something tremendous was going
to happen that day. The first thing his prying
eyes lit upon was one of Jake Utway&rsquo;s boots,
lying carelessly on the floor of the tent. The
boot was caked with sticky black mud almost to
the knee. He pondered this mysterious circumstance
at odd moments during the morning, without
any satisfactory conclusion as to what Jake
might have been doing in the dead of night that
would put his footgear into such a state.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>His feeling that great things were impending
returned to him again and again as the morning
passed. The customary line-up for the flag-raising
was held on the lodge porch, as the rain was
still dripping from low-lying banks of cloud; but
along toward morning swim-time the sky cleared
slightly, and by lunch a watery sun had appeared,
to dry up the muddy campus.</p>
<p>All the time Sherlock had been on the job.
Not once had the Utway twins been out of his
sight.</p>
<p>At lunch, however, he came upon another clue.
Jake appeared to be unusually hungry; it seemed
almost impossible for him to satisfy his appetite.
The long-nosed detective did not link this fact
with the further fact that Jake&rsquo;s blouse, when he
rose from table, bulged suspiciously in front.</p>
<p>After the meal, Sherlock moodily retired to the
dark-room, his favorite spot in which to think
over his information, and to &ldquo;deduce&rdquo; results
therefrom. So far, he had little to go on.</p>
<p>He listened idly for a few moments to the song
of the care-free black boy up in the kitchen.
That brought to mind the recent robbery of the
pantry. Might this have something to do with
the Utway case?</p>
<p>A great light suddenly burst upon Sherlock
Jones. A convict might be badly in need of food.
And an escaped fugitive might well serve as a
secret accomplice&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>A creaking noise near him in the darkness
brought him to wide-awake alertness. Sherlock
strained his ears, eager to catch any further
sound. Absolute silence followed. For a few
moments the boy stood motionless; then he softly
tiptoed to the door, and flung it open. The Utway
twins were in sight, strolling easily down toward
their tents.</p>
<p>They had come from the trunk room! It had
been their footsteps he had heard. But what was
their business there? Had they hidden something?
Perhaps the swag of some midnight
burglary, something that might incriminate them
surely and swiftly?</p>
<p>Yes, the trunk room was assuredly the key to
all the problems that confronted the amateur
sleuth. Without making a sound, he stepped to
the door of the trunk room.</p>
<p>It was a foolish step for young Detective Jones
to make. Yet, whatever his other failings, Sherlock
could not be accused of lack of courage. He
turned the knob and pushed cautiously inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>At first he could see little; it was not until his
eyes were accustomed to the dimness of the room
that he made out a heap of food on the floor, piled
high on a paper napkin. Food! For whom?
For what? He allowed the door to swing behind
him, and bent forward to look more closely.
He was not aware of a shadowy body that
crouched at his side, tense, ready to spring on him
from behind a heap of stacked trunks.</p>
<p>Sherlock Jones did not have a chance to cry
out. A muscular arm circled his throat with a
choking clasp. A bit of cloth was rammed into
his open mouth; wiry arms clutched his own with
a grip like that of a steel trap. His wild struggles
were of no avail. He fell to the floor of the room,
borne down by a strength greater than his own.
As he fell, he saw&mdash;or did he dream?&mdash;that he
was caught in the power of a stranger whose face
was invisible, but on whose arm was tattooed the
design of a flying eagle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SO LONG, LENAPE!</span></h2>
<p>It was past ten o&rsquo;clock that night when Jerry
and Jake Utway tapped softly on the door of
the trunk room. The door opened a crack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s us&mdash;the twins!&rdquo; Jerry whispered
urgently. &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Come in,&rdquo; responded a familiar voice.
The two boys, with a backward look into the starlit
night, slid through the doorway, and Jake
snapped on his flashlight.</p>
<p>They saw before them a stranger. No, it was
Burk&mdash;but a different Burk, a man new-made in
the few hours since they had seen him. Now,
they could see that he was quite a young man, a
being entirely different from the haggard,
bearded fugitive they had rescued. During
siesta hour, as they had promised, they had
smuggled into the hiding-place not only food,
but also a razor with which Jake methodically
scraped his upper lip every two weeks or so.
They had also made up a bundle of clothing extracted
from their camping outfits. But they had
not expected such a transformation as that
which had produced this likeable young fellow
who now smiled back at them in the rays of the
lantern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Burk had shed his drab convict&rsquo;s clothing, torn
and stained as it was. He was now attired in
garments contributed by the twins, and wore a
flannel shirt, black sweater under a Norfolk
jacket, and Jake&rsquo;s corduroy trousers. A pair of
stout army shoes had replaced his sodden prison
footwear. A cloth cap concealed his tell-tale
cropped head; he would not dare to remove that
cap where others might see him. His shaving
operations had left a small, neat mustache on his
lip, which gave him a cocky, cheerful look. In
fact, the food and rest he had taken had done
much to restore him to his old, care-free outlook
upon life. This was a surprising Burk; he was
actually grinning at them, as though his whole
future did not depend upon the outcome of the
adventure upon which they were about to embark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is everything ready?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Jake slowly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve had to
make a few changes in our plans. It&rsquo;s this way.
A goofy kid named Jones, in my tent, has gone
and gotten himself lost somewhere. Our leader
is worried to death about what might have happened
to him&mdash;this kid is a nosy bird we nicknamed
Sherlock, and is always fussing around
trying to detect things. He didn&rsquo;t show up for
supper, and everybody&rsquo;s been chasing all over the
place ever since, trying to find him. We&rsquo;re supposed
to be looking for him now ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, from what you say, that I know the
boy you mean. Well, he detected himself into
some trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen him? You know where he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. If you&rsquo;ll look over in the corner, there
by my bed, you&rsquo;ll find him safe and sound,
though a little scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Utway twins pushed past the speaker, and
tiptoed to the place mentioned. Sure enough;
there on the canvas lay Sherlock Jones, flat on
his back, his wrists pinioned behind him, a gag in
his mouth held in place by his own handkerchief,
above which a pair of pale eyes goggled through
his thick glasses with a piteous, pleading look.
For some hours past, the amateur sleuth had been
expecting a gruesome death any moment from
the mysterious stranger who had trapped him;
now, at sight of the notorious Utway brothers, he
thought his last hour had struck. He wriggled
in his bonds helplessly. Through all the long
time of his captivity, Sherlock Jones had come to
the conclusion that he didn&rsquo;t want to be a famous
detective. If he ever got through this harrowing
experience alive, he&rsquo;d never shadow another suspect
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how did he get here?&rdquo; gasped Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for the poor chap, boys, but it
couldn&rsquo;t be helped. He was smart enough to find
out where I was, and if I hadn&rsquo;t tied him up, he
would have had me caught in the wink of an eye!
It was the only thing I could do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not so good,&rdquo; put in Jake.
&ldquo;Dog-gone it, why did he have to come snooping
around right at this time? It&rsquo;s a mess; it will
make our getaway all the harder. I thought that
all we would have to do would be to sneak out
our stuff after Taps to-night, and hit the trail.
But right now, half the camp is chasing all over
the place, looking for this sap; if we try to get
through now, they might easily spot us, and if we
stay here, they might decide to look in here any
minute. What&rsquo;ll we do with him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what?&rdquo; Jerry echoed. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t
leave pretty quick, we&rsquo;ll be nabbed. Sherlock
heard everything, and we don&rsquo;t dare let him go
now. Even if we leave him here, he&rsquo;ll work loose
sooner or later, and that will be even worse for
us.&rdquo; He glared at the prostrate Sherlock, the
whole cause of this hitch in their carefully laid
plans. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll just have to tie him tight
and get as far away as we can before he&rsquo;s discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two are ready to travel, then?&rdquo; asked
Burk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t get our blankets, because everybody
in the tent is awake and up,&rdquo; said Jerry,
&ldquo;but that&rsquo;s all right. We can start right away,
sure.&rdquo; Both twins wore khaki hiking breeches,
woolen stockings, flannel shirts, and high shoes,
and each wore a heavy mackinaw that would protect
him well from the cold.</p>
<p>Burk&rsquo;s tone was serious. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re still
determined to run away from your friends and
go with me? Don&rsquo;t you think it would be wiser
to let me start off alone, and let me take my
chance without involving you in my trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead sure. We go with you. Honest, we
can help you a lot&mdash;we know all the trails around
here, and we can hike fine. We&rsquo;re with you to see
this through to the finish!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Jake, during this whispered discussion, had
been lost in thought. Now he broke out with the
scheme that had occurred to him. &ldquo;Listen! The
only thing we can do with Sherlock is to take him
with us! Sounds crazy, I know,&rdquo; he went on,
looking at their amazed faces, &ldquo;but we can&rsquo;t
leave him here to let the cat out of the bag as soon
as we&rsquo;re started. If we can take him with us up
the mountain and leave him somewhere, we&rsquo;ll be
far away before he can find his way back and
break the news. What do you think? Anyway,
we&rsquo;ve got to do something right away; the longer
we stick around here, the less chance we&rsquo;ll have
to get clear. The campers are buzzing all over
the place like hornets; pretty soon the moon will
rise, and we won&rsquo;t be able to get ten feet without
being spotted. Do we take him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be the way out,&rdquo; said Burk
slowly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault that we&rsquo;re in this fix, and
I don&rsquo;t want the poor fellow to suffer any more
than he has to. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; The delay was telling
on the man&rsquo;s nerves. He longed to get into
the open, and start the dash for Canoe Mountain;
each minute they lingered would bring them fresh
difficulties. &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll take the lad. You two
lead the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Without ceremony, Burk lifted the helpless
Sherlock and slung him over his shoulder in the
position known as &ldquo;fireman&rsquo;s lift.&rdquo; The bound
boy was too helpless to put up a struggle as he
was borne away in this undignified fashion, and
hung limply while Burk, with cat-like steps,
made for the door in the wake of the Utway
twins.</p>
<p>It was a fine night outside. The air smelled
fresh and cool; later it would be edged with the
chill of the mountains, but now it was soft and
spicy with pine scents, and breathing it brought
a recklessness to one&rsquo;s senses. The lodge above
the little party was dark, but several lanterns
burned among the tents below them on the hillside,
rivalling the far pale radiance of the constellations
in the summer heavens. Taking care
that not the slightest noise should disturb the
watchful searchers scattered in the darkness
about them, the twins led the way past the
windows of the kitchen, scouted ahead as far as
the side of the ice-house, and beckoned the burdened
man to follow. A breathless dash, and they
were in the cover of the low bushes that grew on
the camp side of the wood-road, and here they
paused a moment for breath.</p>
<p>Jake felt his brother&rsquo;s fingers clutch his arm
with a swift start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; breathed Jerry. Coming down the
path were four or five dim forms, their legs showing
in the yellow pool of light from the big
lantern that marched with them. Burk also saw
the advancing squad. Unceremoniously he
dumped his bound burden among the bushes, and
flopped down beside it, just in time. The lantern
was swung high over the bearer&rsquo;s head, and a
voice challenged them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake recognized the tall, spare figure of his
councilor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jake!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Did you
find anything, Mr. Avery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim Avery left the group a few steps, to meet
them. Already he was dangerously close upon
the hidden figures. &ldquo;No, not yet. We were just
up to the hospital tent. No sign of him. We&rsquo;re
going down to the dock again now. Hadn&rsquo;t you
boys better get to bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go to sleep as long as old Sherlock
is missing,&rdquo; responded Jake truthfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, better go to the tent soon, anyway.
And don&rsquo;t get too far away from camp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The councilor hurried off to catch up with the
rest of the search party. Jake and Jerry
breathed sighs of relief as the light was taken
from their faces, and they watched it bobbing off
down the hill toward the baseball field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! That was a close call! Jerry, I
thought I&rsquo;d yell if he came an inch closer!&rdquo; Jake
drew his sleeve across his brow. &ldquo;Guess we can
start again now, Mr. Burk. Can we help you
any with packing Sherlock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burk was already on his feet again, lifting the
inert body to his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can manage, thanks,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;But
as soon as we get out of the danger zone, I&rsquo;m going
to untie the poor chap. This must be hurting
him. He can&rsquo;t do any damage now, if we untie
him. I&rsquo;m sure sorry I had to lash him up this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fell in behind the two boys, now striking
through the patch of cleared woodland that led to
the road. Their plan was to follow the road for
about half a mile, circle the farm where it ended,
and from there head through the mountains
southward, along the Lenape range toward
Canoe Mountain. The night was yet young, and
they hoped to put some miles between the camp
and themselves before morning would force them
to stop, rest, and hide from any possible discovery.
A sallow tinge on the eastern horizon
told them that the moon would shortly be rising,
to light them on their fleeting way. Behind them
trudged the man Burk, his burden heavy but his
heart lighter than it had been for many a day,
and the taste of freedom on his lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>As they topped a rising knoll above the road,
Jake Utway looked back. He could still see a
few dancing lights, like will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps over the
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long, Lenape!&rdquo; he said softly, and headed
up the road, on the first leg of their dash for
Canoe Mountain. Something told him that he
would pass through many hazardous passages before
he again saw the familiar scenes of the camp
by the lake. Their daring venture had taken
them outside the pale of law, now; every man&rsquo;s
hand would be against them. There would be no
ease for them until somehow, somewhere, they
could prove that the courts of the land had pronounced
guilty an innocent man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">FOUR IN THE FOREST</span></h2>
<p>In the far corner of Farmer Podgett&rsquo;s meadow
the little party stopped. They stood knee-high
in tall grass by the fence, their legs spattered
with dew. Burk leaned his helpless load
against the fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Sherlock,&rdquo; said Jerry into his tent-mate&rsquo;s
ear; &ldquo;if we untie you, will you promise
not to yell or try to get away? It won&rsquo;t do you
any good now&mdash;we&rsquo;re too far from camp for them
to hear you. We don&rsquo;t want to hurt you unless
you&rsquo;re stubborn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captive nodded his head vigorously. He
would promise anything in the world to get free
of those cutting ropes that bound him, and the
gag that almost stopped his breathing. Without
more ado, Burk untied the handkerchief that
held the gag, and worked loose the knotted rope
that pinioned the boy&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, son!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That feel better?
Let me tell you, I didn&rsquo;t want to tie you up this
way; I&rsquo;m sorry I had to do it. No hard feelings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some minutes poor Sherlock could not
speak. Had he not been leaning against the
timber fence, he would have toppled over to the
ground, so stiff were his cramped muscles. Jerry
rubbed his arms briskly, and tears came into
Sherlock&rsquo;s eyes as circulation returned to his
aching wrists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, take it easy, old man,&rdquo; counseled
Burk. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hike along slow, and you&rsquo;ll soon
limber up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;where are you taking me?&rdquo; asked
the boy fearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind now; you&rsquo;ll find out later,&rdquo; said
Jerry. &ldquo;Here, put on my mackinaw; you&rsquo;re
cold. Now, let&rsquo;s be on our way.&rdquo; He helped
young Jones into the warm garment, and guided
him along the fence to the gate. The four passed
through, and were soon lost in the shadow of the
woods again, heading southward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>A bright half-moon was rising over the tree
tops, and its beams slanted through the leafy
arches overhead, lighting their path. They followed
a trail which the twins knew ran along the
foot of the range for some miles, well above the
rich farmlands below Lake Lenape. Podgett&rsquo;s
hounds bayed afar as they passed beyond the
sleeping farmhouse. Jake Utway was in the
lead; Jerry followed, his arm about the shoulders
of their captive; Burk brought up the rear guard,
silent-footed, watchful, awake. The pace was
not brisk, as Sherlock was still unable to travel
rapidly. Thus, in silence, they threaded the trail
through the woodlands.</p>
<p>It was past midnight when Jake halted on a
spur of hill. By the side of the road was a spring
he knew of, and all the hikers refreshed themselves
with an icy draught of its water. Off to
their left they caught a glimpse of moonlight
glinting on the face of the lake. Jerry shivered
slightly; without his mackinaw, he felt the chill
of the night winds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a good place to ditch Mr. Tagalong,&rdquo;
he observed. &ldquo;Old Sherlock won&rsquo;t find his way
home from here easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sherlock, who had maintained a terrified
silence during the march through the woods, now
cried out in horror. &ldquo;You mean&mdash;you&rsquo;d leave
me here? Alone? Please, Jerry, I never meant
to do you any harm! Don&rsquo;t leave me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t take you with us any farther,&rdquo; said
Jerry, cold-bloodedly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got enough
trouble ourselves, without bothering with you.
We&rsquo;re travelling light this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;I&rsquo;d be lost! I&rsquo;m lost right now!&rdquo;
he pleaded. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s probably a lot of bears in
these woods. Do you want me to be eaten up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no bears around here,&rdquo; Jerry answered
disdainfully. &ldquo;Come on, brace up, Sherlock.
We can&rsquo;t take you, and that&rsquo;s that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sherlock turned pleadingly to Jake. &ldquo;You
and me are tent-mates, Jakie! You won&rsquo;t desert
me up here, will you? We&rsquo;ve been pretty good
friends, haven&rsquo;t we? Just tell me what you want
me to do, and I&rsquo;ll do it. I can hike fast, honest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake shook his head. &ldquo;Sorry, but we&rsquo;ve got a
long way to go, and a big job to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know! I heard what you said back at camp&mdash;you&rsquo;re
going to help this man get away from
the police. Well, if you only don&rsquo;t leave me,
why, I&rsquo;ll help too! I swear I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake considered. &ldquo;Think we could do it,
fellows? I admit I hate to leave him up here; he
might hurt himself, and never get back. He&rsquo;s
not a bad guy. We don&rsquo;t dare let him tell what
he knows, and maybe it would work out all right
if we took him along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Jerry gave in. &ldquo;All right; but he&rsquo;ll sure have
to travel to keep up with us. What do you think,
Mr. Burk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burk shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t very well see what
else we can do. You know who I am, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you are a&mdash;a convict! You
said you were sorry you had to tie me up, and I
believe you! If I can help you get away, I&rsquo;ll do
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; explained Jake.
&ldquo;Mr. Burk is not trying to make a getaway.
He wants to get a chance to prove he&rsquo;s not
guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell you everything later. In the meantime,
you can come along with us and take your
chance like the rest. But if you make one move
to give us away&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; His unspoken words
carried a threat that Sherlock did not dare ignore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come!&rdquo; Young Detective Jones was
feeling better already. After all, if he could not
expose a desperate criminal, the next most exciting
thing was joining that criminal&rsquo;s band in an
effort to baffle the forces of the law. &ldquo;Here,
Jerry, take your mackinaw. I feel warm
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get going again,&rdquo; urged Jake, rising.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay here all night; we&rsquo;ll get too
stiff to move if we sit down any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again they took the weary trail. Their steps
now were slower; it took more effort for them to
keep up a ringing, mile-eating stride. Down in
his heart, the impatient Burk knew that he could
not keep up the pace many hours longer; his brief
rest at Lenape had not been enough to make up
for the many days of starvation and exposure he
had undergone. His prison life, too, had taken
from him his old endurance; he was no longer
the steel-muscled hunter he had been a year ago.
And he realized that the twins, for several nights,
had taken considerably less than their usual
ration of sleep; their nightly forays had fatigued
them, as he could tell by their actions, and no
doubt the attendant excitement had also told
upon them. One cannot live in an atmosphere
of mysterious incidents and midnight captures
without paying for them in physical strain. And
Sherlock, the least hardy of them all, had been
trussed up tightly for half a day, and was in no
condition to endure the demands of a long hike
in the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Left&mdash;right&mdash;left! The quartette, strung
along the trail in Indian file, lifted their feet more
leadenly as one endless mile followed another.
The moon was right overhead now; they were a
long way from Lenape, marching somewhere on
the flank of the mountains. Only the sound of
their footsteps attended them, except now and
then the rasping hunting-cry of an owl, that
nocturnal marauder, and once, up the ridge, the
short bark of a fox. Several times they crossed
the beds of swift hill-streams, and once they
floundered about in a spreading thicket of rhododendrons
for some minutes before Jerry, in the
lead, found the trail again.</p>
<p>Sherlock Jones felt that he could not go
another step. He was shivering with the cold;
if only they would stop this eternal, steady plodding,
mile after mile, and light a fire! Left&mdash;right&mdash;&mdash; He
wondered if the twins had
brought any food on this mad trip; he could see
that they were hampered neither by provisions
nor blankets&mdash;travelling light, as Jerry had said.
What would they eat? When would they stop?
Were they going to keep on this way for a
thousand years, forever, putting one foot in front
of the other, with never a word&mdash;&mdash; A tear
trickled down Sherlock&rsquo;s grimy cheek. He kept
on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>The strain of the past few days was putting its
mark upon the twins. At last Jerry paused in
a little clear space beside a brook. Jake marched
past him, stumbled over a fallen branch, and
almost fell. He turned his face to them, white in
the moonlight, and muttered drowsily, &ldquo;Guess
I was asleep! I&rsquo;ve heard of fellows falling asleep
on their feet, but this is the first time it ever happened
to me! Where are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of the party halted. &ldquo;I calculate
we&rsquo;ve done about twelve miles since we left your
camp,&rdquo; said Burk. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;ve kept straight
south, we should be a good distance away. I
think you&rsquo;ve been heading right, because we&rsquo;ve
kept to the side of the mountain all the time.
Wallistown ought to be in striking distance, over
that way; but I think we should try to keep to
the hills&mdash;too dangerous to get closer to town.
Now, I can see that you chaps are pretty well
fagged out. You&rsquo;ve stood the march like soldiers,
and not a word of complaint; but it&rsquo;s clear to
me we can&rsquo;t get any farther to-night. We&rsquo;ll have
to lay up until to-morrow evening. Naturally I
want to get to Canoe Mountain as soon as possible,
but it won&rsquo;t do to start our trip with too big
a jump. If we went much farther to-night, we&rsquo;d
bite off more than we could chew&mdash;we&rsquo;d be sore
and laid up with blisters and aches, and in no
shape to put up a good race. I&rsquo;m the least tired
of any of us. What do you say if I push ahead
and try to locate a place to stop?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>The twins agreed; Sherlock had no breath to
spare for talk. Burk took a hitch in his corduroys,
waved his hand, and springing across the
brook, vanished beyond, up the trail.</p>
<p>The boys did not dare to sit down, for fear
that their muscles would stiffen in that position
and they would not to be able to rise and walk
again. When their breathing became more regular,
the Utway brothers roused Sherlock and
pushed on. They had not gone five hundred
yards when they made out a figure striding toward
them in the moonlight. It was Burk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good news!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bit of
luck! I happened to see the moonlight striking
on a glass window over here. Come on through!
There&rsquo;s a little ramshackle hut here. Not a soul
has been around for a long time, as near as I can
see. Probably this cabin was built by some tie-cutters.
Over this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed him, warmed to the heart by
this smile of fortune. Concealed amidst the
trees, a hundred yards from the trail, was a low,
one-roomed shanty of slabs, chinked with clay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;There was no lock on the door,&rdquo; explained
the discoverer, &ldquo;so I just walked in. There&rsquo;s a
fireplace and some wood; we ought to be warm
enough, even if we have no blankets. And I
guess we&rsquo;re so tired that we won&rsquo;t mind bedding
down on the floor, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake threw his flashlight about the tiny dwelling.
Dust rose from the slab floor; cobwebs
everywhere seemed to prove that the place had
indeed been deserted for some time past. It was
a better refuge than they could have hoped for;
a snug little cabin where they could lie up until
the next evening brought them a chance to continue
their long hike.</p>
<p>Jerry was already busy, kindling a fire on the
narrow stone hearth. Welcome flames were soon
leaping up to warm their numb bodies, and Jerry,
like the rest, considered their luck in finding such
a haven in the depths of the woods. But he had
a more pressing matter in his head. There were
four of them, and they would have to pass at
least one day here, with nothing to eat but, perhaps,
the few berries they could find in the forest.
Four hungry mouths! No fun marching on an
empty stomach&mdash;&mdash; The others were already
stretched out on the floor, with their coats under
them, close beside the glowing hearth. Jerry
scratched his head; then fished in his pockets and
drew out a handful of coins and counted them.
Not very much, but it would buy a few cans of
beans, some bread, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Jake lifted his head from the hard floor.
&ldquo;Listen, Sherlock,&rdquo; he warned, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try to get
out of here without letting us know. First move
you make toward that door, I&rsquo;ll rise up and bust
you one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t move! I&rsquo;m one of you now, Jake!
I won&rsquo;t run away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo; He saw Jerry still
standing beside the fire. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s biting you,
Jerry? Why don&rsquo;t you come to bed with the rest
of the gang? Want me to sing you a lullaby?
What are you up to, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry put his money back into his pocket, and
yawned. &ldquo;Oh, nothing!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Nothing
at all. Good night. Say, I hope the owner
of this shanty don&rsquo;t come rolling in along about
morning. He&rsquo;ll want to charge us rent.&rdquo; He
chuckled. &ldquo;Wonder what Mr. Jim Avery is
thinking now, back at camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A snore answered him. Jerry Utway spread
his mackinaw across the least rough patch of floor
he could find, stretched out his full length with
feet toward the fire, and closed his weary eyes.
&ldquo;Nothing at all!&rdquo; he murmured drowsily. In
five minutes he was asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">HARE AND HOUNDS</span></h2>
<p>Jake Utway stirred uneasily. Something
was digging into his hip, bluntly shoving him
back to consciousness. He sat up. Was it
Reveille so soon? But this wasn&rsquo;t Tent Ten! For
a moment he stared, sticky-eyed, into a small fireplace
heaped with flaky white wood-ash. In a
flash it came back to him&mdash;the escape from
Lenape; the moonlight march with their captive,
Sherlock; the discovery of the shack in the
woods&mdash;&mdash; Jake groaned softly, and stretched
his cramped body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody awake?&rdquo; he asked drowsily. &ldquo;Boy,
but I&rsquo;m stiff! This log floor&mdash;maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t
have slept against the grain of the wood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud sneeze at his side answered him, followed
by a series of sniffles and a second sneeze.
He turned and discovered Sherlock Jones, with
tears in his pale eyes, rubbing his nose with a
grimy handkerchief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bad coad!&rdquo; explained the ex-detective with
another sneeze. It was plain that Sherlock was
not made of the stuff of outlaw heroes. Reddened
eyes, a dripping nose, and chattering teeth
were the penalties of his moonlight jaunt and
his night in the backwoods hut. &ldquo;Very dasty
coad! Say, who pud this thig over be?&rdquo; Sherlock
had noticed for the first time that a norfolk
jacket had been carefully thrown over his body
some time in the night. It was the garment worn
by Burk, who had evidently tucked it about the
sleeping boy as a protection against the night
breezes that penetrated through the cracks in the
floor of the hut. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Bister Burk? Oh,
there you are. <i>A-choo!</i> Thags very buch, Bister
Burk. You bust have been coad yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, old man!&rdquo; Burk rolled over and
yawned. &ldquo;Sorry you have a cold, though.&rdquo; Of
a sudden the man sprang up. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the
other fellow?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Jake looked about him. Jerry was not in the
little room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your brother? Did he tell you he
was going out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no!&rdquo; said Jake. &ldquo;He must be somewhere
around, though. He can&rsquo;t have gone far.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>The sun was high; a dazzling, glorious stream
of light poured in through a dusty window.
Sherlock pointed with his handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whad&rsquo;s that over the fireblace?&rdquo; he snuffled.</p>
<p>Jake jumped up to look. A bit of paper was
stuck prominently into the cracks of the stone
mantel. It was an old envelope, on the face of
which was scrawled a few cramped lines of writing
in pencil. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a note&mdash;a note from Jerry!&rdquo;
he exclaimed in surprise. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; echoed the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; listen to this: &lsquo;Dear Jakie and Others&mdash;We&rsquo;ve
got to have grub, so I&rsquo;m going to
Wallistown. Will bring it as soon as I can.
Will try to get some news if I can. Don&rsquo;t worry
about me.&mdash;Jerry.&rsquo; Well, what do you think of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thig it&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; sighed Sherlock. &ldquo;I sure
could eat somethig right dow!&rdquo; Burk said nothing,
but took up a couple of holes in his belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like Jerry,&rdquo; observed Jake, sticking
the note in his pocket. &ldquo;He knew we&rsquo;d have
to stay here in hiding all day, and didn&rsquo;t want us
to starve. We need grub, sure enough. But it&rsquo;s
no use for him to tell us not to worry&mdash;anything
in the world might happen to him in Wallistown,
and I won&rsquo;t rest easy until I see him back here
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;You thig he may get into druble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Sherlock, that cold of yours must be
affecting your brain. Don&rsquo;t you know that
everybody in the world will be after us, after
what happened last night? We can&rsquo;t just disappear&mdash;the
Chief and all the rest back at camp
will be hunting for us, and they&rsquo;re sure to connect
our disappearance with Burk here. That&rsquo;s why
we can&rsquo;t travel in the daytime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where do you wad to travel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake threw up his hands. &ldquo;Listen! It&rsquo;s plain
we&rsquo;ve got to tell you everything. Mr. Burk was
put in jail for being a thief, but he didn&rsquo;t steal
the necklace. If we can get to Canoe Mountain
Lodge, he thinks we can prove that he&rsquo;s innocent.
And we&rsquo;ve got to get there! Now do you
savvy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad&rsquo;s wad I thought all the tibe,&rdquo; nodded
Sherlock sagely. &ldquo;I said Bister Burk was all
right, and I probise to help if I cad. <i>A-choo!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jake, &ldquo;you can help us a lot&mdash;&mdash; Jiminy,
what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was small wonder that Jake was startled. A
sound had broken the stillness of the forest, a
chilling, heart-gripping hullabaloo from the
north, toward Lenape&mdash;the high belling howl of
a pack of hounds on a warm trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dogs!&rdquo; Burk clenched his fists. &ldquo;By heaven,
they&rsquo;ve got bloodhounds out!&rdquo; His pallid face
went whiter still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bloodhounds! You mean&mdash;they&rsquo;re pointing
out our trail last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;listen!&rdquo; It came again, the terrifying
chorus of their sharp-nosed pursuers. &ldquo;They
can&rsquo;t be far off! Boys, we can&rsquo;t stay here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;where will we go?&rdquo; said Jake, shakily.
&ldquo;If Jerry comes back here, he&rsquo;s sure to be
caught!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help that!&rdquo; Burk was gathering together
their few belongings over his arm. He
ran to the door, and cooked his ear up the trail.
&ldquo;Come along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sherlock Jones, at the first awesome baying
of the pack, had given himself up for dead.
Bloodhounds! He struggled weakly to his feet,
found Jake pulling his arm, leading him toward
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we stay here, we&rsquo;ll be cornered!&rdquo; cried the
man. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not far off now&mdash;they&rsquo;ll be on
us in a few minutes!&rdquo; The baying call sounded
again, much louder, it seemed. &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>He plunged into the woods, looking back to see
if the boys were following. Jake was having difficulties;
he had almost to push the bewildered
Sherlock every inch of the way. The vision of
a pack of fiendish hounds leaping at his throat,
pulling him down, almost paralyzed the poor lad;
he stumbled along at Jake&rsquo;s side, shivering, sneezing,
almost falling headlong. Again rose in the
still air the hunting-cry of the beasts on their
track.</p>
<p>Jake noticed that the man was leading them
downhill, fighting his way through the scratching
underbrush. Where could they be going?
In which direction lay an instant&rsquo;s safety from
that yapping Nemesis at their backs? The two
boys leaped down a steep declivity, saw Burk
standing in a little ravine below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to wade
in this brook a ways&mdash;that will shake them off for
a bit!&rdquo; He started down the course of the swift
stream, splashing rainbow drops up to his knees,
rattling stones with his hurrying feet.</p>
<p>Jake herded his charge into the water, and took
the plunge himself, driving Sherlock ahead of
him down the rough descent. For some two hundred
yards they stumbled forward in panic,
ankle-deep in the chill rivulet. The stream was
rapidly becoming wider, fanning outward to
form a little pool. Beyond, they saw Burk, wading
waist-high across to a little spot of grassland
sheltered among tall poplar trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>Somehow&mdash;Jake never could explain it to himself
afterward&mdash;he forced the stricken Sherlock
through the pool and helped him to climb the
muddy bank, where the dazed boy lay where he
fell, his thick glasses knocked over one ear, his
eyes streaming, caught in the clutch of a sneezing
fit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t go on!&rdquo; Sherlock gasped. &ldquo;I
dow I probised to help&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burk bent over him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get away,
old man! You can&rsquo;t stay here&mdash;they&rsquo;ll find you
in a minute.&rdquo; He helped the boy to his feet, and
with Jake on the other side, they continued their
mad progress, almost dragging the limp body
of young Jones between them.</p>
<p>As they ran, Burk jerked out a few directions.
&ldquo;I think I know where we are now. It&rsquo;s dangerous
ground&mdash;but the dogs have driven us out of
the mountains. We&rsquo;ve got to find more water&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the only thing that will shake them off
our trail. And I think this little brook empties
into Lake Wallis&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Jake looked back over his shoulder. Above
them, to the northward, he caught a view of a
figure for an instant, clear against the skyline&mdash;the
silhouette of a mounted man, galloping along
the trail. Again came the bloodthirsty belling of
the hounds. Had they found the hut?</p>
<p>Again the fugitives were among the trees. Of
a sudden Sherlock Jones collapsed; had they not
caught him, he would have fallen headlong on
his face. Jake and Burk exchanged glances.
With the pursuers so close on their heels, burdened
as they were with a helpless boy&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Sherlock was mumbling something, through
chattering teeth. &ldquo;You go ahead&mdash;leave be
here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake shook him. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t leave you, old
scout! Just a few steps more&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;can&rsquo;t bake it&mdash;&mdash; I&rsquo;ll clibe a tree, so
the dogs can&rsquo;t get be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can?&rdquo; asked Burk eagerly.
&ldquo;Say, if you could get into a tree, the dogs
would stop for a while, and we might get free! If
only you could do it, hold them at bay for a few
minutes&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; It was true that the boy was a
hindrance to their flight, and could be nothing
but a danger to them; but could he be left behind
to hold the yapping hounds, who were sure to
pause if they found their quarry treed, he might
gain for them a few priceless seconds&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it! I said I&rsquo;d help you, Bister Burk!&rdquo;
gulped Sherlock bravely. &ldquo;Just put be into a
tree&mdash;a big tree&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George, that might do it!&rdquo; said Burk,
admiringly. &ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ll hoist him up this
one.&rdquo; He indicated a smooth-barked poplar with
a low branch hanging just above them. &ldquo;Give
him a lift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no time for delay. Like a sack of
flour, Sherlock&rsquo;s form was heaved against the
trunk of the tree with a mighty swing. He
waved his arms desperately, caught hold of the
limb, and scrambled aloft amid a shower of leaves
and bark, kicking his dripping feet wildly behind
him. Like a treed raccoon, he huddled in a crotch
of the tree and tried to make himself small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rud!&rdquo; he shouted to the two below. &ldquo;I&rsquo;b
all right. I won&rsquo;t tell theb a thig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two on the ground hesitated no longer.
Jake did not dare look back; he had all he could
do to keep up with the racing man at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sherlock&rsquo;s game, all right!&rdquo; he managed to
gasp. &ldquo;He came through fine; I never thought
he had it in him! Think he can hold them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Through his mind flashed the thought that already
their party was scattered; Jerry was gone,
Heaven alone knew where, and now Sherlock
had sacrificed himself so that the others might
have an instant&rsquo;s start. Good old Sherlock! He
had helped them after all&mdash;&mdash; They burst
through the last of the trees, into a spreading
pasture land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One chance in a hundred!&rdquo; Burk was crying
through clenched teeth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fool them yet!
If we can only get as far as Lake Wallis&mdash;&mdash; Cross
water! Now, son, don&rsquo;t try to say anything
more now!&rdquo; The two racing fugitives
dashed through the grass in the hot sunlight.
&ldquo;Save your breath! We&rsquo;ve got to run now as
we never ran before!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JERRY GETS A RIDE</span></h2>
<p>Jerry had awakened about eight o&rsquo;clock,
scribbled his brief note, and crept from the
hut in the woods without disturbing any of his
sleeping companions. His mind was made up.
Burk had said that Wallistown was not far away,
and there he could certainly purchase the food
they needed so badly. Since they were forced
to hide here until nightfall, his brief desertion
would not hold up their march. And he knew
they would be hungry. He was hungry already.
The keen, fresh morning air whipped up his appetite
as he hiked steadily down the trail. Birds
were flashing through the dewy thickets about
him, caroling their morning-songs; not a cloud
hung in the sky.</p>
<p>He came to an old moss-covered stone fence,
crossed over, and found himself in a lane, lined
with tall elder bushes, with dark rich clusters of
small berries hanging among the leaves. A rich
find! He filled his mouth with the bitter-tasting
fruit, which stained his hands a deep purple as
he ate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Feeling refreshed by this woodsy breakfast, he
decided to follow the lane. It led him half a mile,
coming out at a white frame farmhouse where a
woman was washing clothes in the yard. She
looked up as he passed and watched him
strangely, but said nothing, and he walked on to
the road beyond. This was a dirt-covered highway
which evidently led in the direction he wished
to take. He swung along steadily through rich
farm-lands and pastures where cattle grazed. A
hay-wagon driven by a man in a large straw hat
passed him; he did not look up, but had a feeling
that the driver was watching him steadily. The
road twisted and curved until Jerry had to get
his bearings from the mountains before he was
sure he was on the right track. Two miles farther,
he came to a signpost that informed him
that Wallis Springs lay to his left, while Wallistown
was still seven miles away. This hike was
farther than he had supposed; he might not be
able to return to his comrades for some hours yet.
Nevertheless, he knew that Wallis Springs was
nothing more than a little group of summer cottages
where he might not be able to purchase any
food; he must push on to Wallistown, at the foot
of the lake. He swung off down the curving
road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>The sun was now high overhead; he was hot,
dusty, and a trifle tired. He took off his mackinaw
and slung it over his arm, wishing he had
left it behind. Now and then he could see to his
left the fringe of trees that bordered the big lake,
and could make out the roofs of little cabins occupied
by people who were summering on its
shores. The road twisted in and out, following
the wavy outline of the lake&rsquo;s bank; no matter
how fast he tried to walk, Wallistown seemed to
be as far away as ever. He begged a glass of
water from a friendly, red-faced woman who answered
his knock at a little cottage beside the
road, and went on. Several automobiles passed
him, driving toward town, but none of their occupants
offered to stop and give him a lift, and
he did not dare ask for a ride. People who picked
you up, he had found, were often very curious
about where you were going and why; they asked
too many questions, and he was in no frame of
mind to undergo any cross-examinations this
morning. It was almost eleven o&rsquo;clock when he
halted to rest beside a bridge that spanned a
little stream which wandered toward the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>A whirring drone sounded above him; a cross-shaped
shadow skimmed across a field by the
road. An airplane hummed overhead, flying
low, almost hitting the tree tops. Jerry wondered
idly why the pilot took a chance of crashing by
flying so close to the ground. The plane circled
and swung off toward the mountains, and Jerry
dismissed it from his mind. If he had known
that this airplane was combing the country for
traces of Burk and the missing boys, he might
not have dismissed it so easily.</p>
<p>He rose and plodded ahead down the dusty
road. Wallistown was in sight now. He could
see the group of two-story buildings that marked
its main street, leading from the wharf where a
number of canoes, rowboats, and small motor
launches were tied up. It was getting late; he
decided to keep as far as possible from the center
of town, where he might be observed. There was
no use taking any chances, and he must start
right back, to have time to carry the food he
would purchase back over the long miles that
now separated him from his friends in the
mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>At one side of the wharf was a line of low
buildings. Jerry left the road and followed a
wooden sidewalk along the bank of the lake, and
made out, on the front of the largest of these
buildings, a sign that proclaimed it to be a
grocery and &ldquo;general store.&rdquo; This was as close
to the town as he wished to go. The sight of so
many strange faces&mdash;people who probably had
never even heard of Camp Lenape&mdash;frightened
him a little. If he hadn&rsquo;t come so far, and hadn&rsquo;t
known that his brother and the rest were depending
on him to bring them some grub, he might
have turned back right there. As it was, he
quickened his pace and entered the shadow of the
store.</p>
<p>The interior of the place was gloomy, after the
sunlight outside, and was filled with a thousand
different odors, chief among them being those of
stale candy and dried fish. An old man was
lounging in a chair which leaned back against
the counter; he moved his head lazily to look at
this customer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll ye have, bud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A couple cans of beans, and some other stuff&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know just what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, look around and pick &rsquo;em out. Guess
we got what ye want,&rdquo; the man answered, and
leaned back again with his arms behind his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Jerry poked about among the shelves in the
back of the store. They wouldn&rsquo;t have much
chance to cook; better to take things that would
carry easily, and that they could eat cold&mdash;bread
and cheese and chocolate&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>The old man Slammed the four legs of his chair
to the floor with a bang, as someone entered hurriedly
through the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got my order ready, Mr. Clay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Rufe. Say, did ye find that canoe of
yourn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newcomer was breathing heavily. Jerry
darted a glance at him. He saw a stringy youth
with a pimpled face, garbed in a jersey and dingy
white flannels, whose voice now took on a tone of
injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, we found it floatin&rsquo; down by the outlet.
They must have landed in some hurry; Talk
about nerve! I was choppin&rsquo; some wood up by
our place above the Springs. These two come
burstin&rsquo; out of the woods, runnin&rsquo; like blazes, and
got away with the canoe before I even had time
to yell. I run along shore about half a mile, but
they had started across, and I couldn&rsquo;t do a thing.
Pretty soon along comes a man on a horse, gallopin&rsquo;
along like mad. He asks me if I&rsquo;ve seen
this pair&mdash;he&rsquo;s a deputy sheriff, he says. You
could have knocked me over with a feather when
he tells me that one of the guys who stole the
canoe was this convict that&rsquo;s been missin&rsquo; from
the Pen at Elmville!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t say! Wal, did he catch &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet. They got ashore by the outlet,
like I told you. They&rsquo;re still loose around here
somewheres; this sheriff feller says he hunted &rsquo;em
with dogs, and got one, but these two got clean
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry was frozen in his place, one hand still
gripping a can of corned beef. It couldn&rsquo;t be
true! Hunted with dogs! And one of them
captured!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the old storekeeper
with grim satisfaction; &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll see, Rufe, them
fellers won&rsquo;t get far. That there airyoplane they
got flyin&rsquo; around is like to spot &rsquo;em if they try to
break across country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they do get caught,&rdquo; said the youth
vengefully. &ldquo;Stealin&rsquo; my canoe! Jimmy from
the newspaper office was just tellin&rsquo; me this convict
feller had got some kids from a camp up the
line to help him get away last night. Must have
been one of &rsquo;em I saw with this man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did the boy look like?&rdquo; Jerry blurted
out, and instantly wished he had bitten out his
tongue rather than speak those words. His concern
for his brother had made him forget how
perilous was his own position.</p>
<p>The youth in flannels turned upon him slowly.
&ldquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s any of your affair, Mr. Butt-In, he
was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The speaker gasped, and surveyed
Jerry from head to toe. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;from
what I saw of him, he looked just like you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man cackled with laughter. &ldquo;Guess
that&rsquo;ll fix &rsquo;im, eh, Rufe? Pretty fast answer,
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, I mean he&mdash;he really does look like him!
I only caught a glimpse of this kid when he was
runnin&rsquo; to the canoe, but I could swear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The storekeeper&rsquo;s chuckles broke off. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
mean to say ye think this young feller is a des-prit
criminal, do ye, Rufe? Why, this feller
come in just as cool as a cucumber&mdash;wanted some
beans, he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry thought rapidly. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want
any now!&rdquo; he said boldly. &ldquo;You can keep your
old stuff. I don&rsquo;t want to listen to all your talk,
after this!&rdquo; He started with determination for
the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Half a minute!&rdquo; The youth called Rufe
barred his way. &ldquo;Maybe you weren&rsquo;t the same
feller that took my canoe, but you act kind of
funny to me. Maybe you know somethin&rsquo; about
all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry did not pause. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy! Just
try to stop me!&rdquo; His heart was in his mouth,
but he tried to look unconcerned, and pushed his
way ahead. The other looked as if he would hold
him by force; but evidently thinking better of
it, he stepped aside, and Jerry passed out into
the street.</p>
<p>His whole body was quivering at the suddenness
of this encounter. Sherlock caught&mdash;Jake
and Burk escaping in a canoe from a mounted
rider who had tracked them! Why, he had left
them sleeping miles away only a few hours ago!
And now&mdash;they must be near him, in danger, expecting
any moment to be taken!</p>
<p>Briskly, he crossed the street, and walked hastily
down toward the business section of town,
taking no notice of the groups of people who
passed him. Was the game up so soon? Rufe
hadn&rsquo;t looked very convinced&mdash;&mdash; Jerry glanced
guiltily over his shoulder. Down the street by a
garage he caught sight of a pair of flanneled legs
in warm pursuit. He was being followed!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>He turned the first corner he came to, leading
into a narrow street, and broke into a heated run.
How far could he get before the youth behind
him saw his flight, and raised a hue and cry?
Gritting his teeth, Jerry plunged down the street.
It was only two blocks long, and ended in a high
board fence. There was no way out; he was in
a blind alley. Out of the tail of his eye he caught
sight of his pursuer, who had turned the corner
and was now in full cry after him, shouting something
Jerry could not make out. There was only
one thing to do. Jerry leaped at the fence,
caught his hands in the rough top, and swung
over. With smarting palms, he landed in a heap
on the other side. There was no time to waste.
He sprang up, and found himself in a little field
full of daisies. Ahead lay a line of telegraph
wires, strung on poles fringing a shining asphalt
road. It must be the state highway! If he could
only get to the road before the youth behind him
could manage to get over the fence&mdash;&mdash;! His
breath was coming in painful, dry sobs; he
couldn&rsquo;t last much longer&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Dimly he made out a car coming up the road
from north, approaching him. He waved an arm
at it, and shouted, although he knew the driver
could not hear him. He was now half-way across
the field; behind him came a cry of rage as Rufe
clambered to the top of the fence&mdash;&mdash; Jerry&rsquo;s
eyes lit up as he saw the car on the highway slow
down, come to a halt not a hundred yards away.
He would make it yet! He waved his arm at the
man in the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had to fight to get out the words. It was
his last chance! To his joy, the driver nodded,
swung open the rear door of the big car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hop in!&rdquo; came a man&rsquo;s jovial voice from the
back seat. Rufe was still coming, but he was no
runner, and the fence-climbing had winded him.
There was still time&mdash;&mdash; Jerry Utway almost
fell into the back of the car, sprawling across a
pair of outstretched legs. The driver slammed
the door; the car, whose engine had not stopped,
responded to the clutch and slipped forward with
a roar. Jerry pulled himself together and fell
backward into a seat, panting out his thanks. He
looked up into the round, jolly face of the man
on his left who had told him to hop in. He was
wedged between this man and another, in the rear
of the car. He turned his head back; through
the window he could see the baffled figure of
Rufe, shaking his fist at the rapidly-moving automobile.
Jerry grinned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>He suddenly realized that he had left his mackinaw
somewhere&mdash;probably back in the grocery
store, when he had walked out so hastily. Well,
he could get it back some time, later&mdash;&mdash; Just
now he had a headache, and things looked a
little blurred.</p>
<p>A voice rumbled at his side&mdash;his right side. It
was the man whose face he had not yet seen.
&ldquo;You were in quite a bit of a hurry back there,
weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; it drawled. &ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t
worry. You can rest now&mdash;rest a long, long
time. I thought you&rsquo;d turn up again, twin, but I
didn&rsquo;t expect it so soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry knew that voice. He knew the man, too,
even before he looked into his face. With a cry,
Jerry sank back into the seat of the speeding car.
It was Diker! Diker, the prison guard! The
man in blue, whom he had last seen at the campfire
on Pebble Beach! And Diker&rsquo;s arm was
locked about his own, in a firm, threatening grip!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE GYPSY VAN</span></h2>
<p>Jake jumped ashore; Burk followed, and
pushed the canoe far out, so that it floated
empty on the face of Lake Wallis.</p>
<p>Never had Jake Utway taken a paddle in such
a wild canoe race! It was impossible that the two
fugitives should still be at liberty. The boy had
given up hope long before they had reached the
lake and taken the canoe; their furious progress
across the half-mile of water had seemed the despairing
effort of a dream; but here they were,
miraculously ashore again, and for the moment
still free. Yet the dream feeling still persisted;
Jake moved his body as if he were wrapped in the
twining coils of a nightmare, when horrors beset
the sleeper and all efforts to escape the menacing
shapes in pursuit are of no avail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired, partner?&rdquo; asked Burk. The man
seemed to be made of whipcord; he had taken the
stern paddle in their mad dash, yet his set face
showed no trace of anything but determination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can keep going,&rdquo; Jake managed to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get somewhere else pretty
quick.&rdquo; Burk pointed toward the far shore from
which they had come. &ldquo;Look over there! See
that little motorboat just pushing out? Well,
I&rsquo;m pretty sure that the people in it won&rsquo;t take
long to get over here and pick up our trail again.
We&rsquo;re in for it again&mdash;but at least we&rsquo;ve got a
few minutes&rsquo; start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready. Which way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burk shook his head. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just got to trust
to our luck now. They&rsquo;ve driven us out into the
open; I&rsquo;m not much good down here near town.
There&rsquo;s only one way we can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had landed on a little spit of gravel on
the east side of Lake Wallis, almost directly
across from the town. There must have been
people over on the wharf who had seen them desert
the canoe, who would put their pursuers on
the track at once; even now, hostile eyes might
be watching their every move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t run&mdash;somebody may be watching us,
and get suspicious,&rdquo; warned the man, and set the
example by walking rapidly away from the border
of the lake. Jake, following, tried to smile;
he felt that he couldn&rsquo;t run even if his life depended
upon it. They climbed a bushy slope,
came out above in a little glade aglow with maple
and sumach. Burk darted a look backward; the
motorboat was already well on its way across,
coming toward them with a feather of spray on
either side of its bows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The state highway runs along here on this
side somewhere,&rdquo; remarked Burk. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
to keep away from it; it&rsquo;s dangerous for us right
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swerved to the right to avoid crossing the
ribbon of asphalt that cut through the woods,
and the two walked parallel to the files of telegraph
wires lining the highway. For five minutes
or so they followed a course which brought
them ever nearer to Wallistown; and each of
those passing minutes, they knew, brought the
net of capture ever closer.</p>
<p>Suddenly Burk gave a sharp exclamation, and
pointed. &ldquo;Something funny ahead!&rdquo; he said
warningly.</p>
<p>It was too late to turn back. A few yards
before them, the highway bent toward them in
a sharp angle. They stopped in their tracks, and
looked on a strange scene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>The queerest vehicle Jake had ever seen was
tilted drunkenly at the side of the road at the
outer corner of the bend. &ldquo;Half flivver, half
covered wagon,&rdquo; the boy described it to himself.
Two little seats huddled behind the steering-wheel;
the remainder of the chassis was roofed
over by a spreading arc of canvas, patched and
weatherworn, stretched over hoops fastened in
the truck-like body of the car, from the rear of
which hung down a few narrow steps. The right-hand
wheel at the rear was firmly bedded in the
ditch; the opposite wheel in front was raised several
inches from the road. Two quaint figures
stood mournfully gazing at the ditched wheel.
One of these was a short, very fat woman of
middle age. She stood with her stout arms
akimbo, and with such a downcast look on her
dark face that Jake almost burst out laughing.
Her arms glittered with several bracelets, and
large rings dangled from her ears. The man at
her side was also short and fat, and also wore
earrings, and in one hand swung a spreading
black hat which, when worn, must have given him
the appearance of an Italian bandit in a stage
melodrama. With his other hand he was scratching
among his graying locks with a perplexed
air.</p>
<p>He must have heard Burk and Jake approaching,
for he wheeled about on his toes, and flashed
a dazzling display of white teeth at them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Jake had taken in the situation in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help you get back on the road, Mister!&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Come on, partner&mdash;let&rsquo;s give
them a hand!&rdquo; He gripped the ditched wheel,
and tried to lift it.</p>
<p>The little man danced about on his toes, while
his wife swung back and forth until her bracelets
and bangles tinkled in delight.</p>
<p>Burk was now at the front of the car. He
pulled back the emergency brake lever, and Jake
felt the strange vehicle starting to roll farther
down into the ditch. He put all his strength
against the tailboard; the little dark man was at
his side. &ldquo;Poosh&mdash;that&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; The boy
heaved, his face red with exertion; Burk had
gripped the spokes of the wheel in the ditch, and
was bending all his effort to force the car from its
lodgment. The united strength of the three of
them slowly shoved the strange little vehicle up
the slanting grade, and in half a minute the car
was back on the road again, headed toward
Wallistown, no worse for its plunge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;Many, many thanks&mdash;many!&rdquo; the dark man
cried happily. He clapped his villainous-looking
hat on his head, and scrambling into the seat,
worked the levers and steering-wheel back and
forth to see that no damage had been done.
&ldquo;You help fine! Come up, Maria!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you help fine!&rdquo; the little man repeated.
&ldquo;Now we go. You go, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going the same way you are,&rdquo; said
Jake quickly. &ldquo;You&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t give us a
lift, could you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For sure! For sure!&rdquo; Their new acquaintance
was all smiles. &ldquo;You help me fine! I help
you a little bit maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They needed no second invitation and darted
around to the tiny set of steps that hung from
the tailboard, sprang one after the other through
the slit in the canvas at the back, and tumbled
into the body of the caravan. An alarming pop-popping
sounded in front; the wheels began to
move, and the car rattled down the highway at
the breath-taking speed of twenty miles an hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Jake looked around the interior of the strange
van. Overhead arched the canvas roof, filtering
the sunshine and splashed with moving shadows
as the car journeyed down the road. He found
himself sitting on the edge of a bunk built across
the floor of the car, directly back of the driver&rsquo;s
seat now occupied by the ridiculous couple whom
they had helped. In one corner was a small
charcoal stove. The interior was heaped with all
sorts of things: a little tin trunk, cooking pots,
a cage with a canary chirping inside, bundles of
clothing; from hooks swung more clothing, a
lantern, a jangling bucket, a spare tire. &ldquo;A regular
house on wheels!&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Wonder
if these people are sure-enough gypsies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little dark man&rsquo;s head appeared as if by
magic through an opening cut in the front of the
canvas, his teeth showing white against his sweeping
mustachios. &ldquo;That ees right! Make yourselfs
like at home, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far are you going?&rdquo; Burk asked him.
&ldquo;To Wallistown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car bumped and shook dangerously; the
head was withdrawn and the machine put back
on its course again. Then the rolling black eyes
were turned on them once more. &ldquo;What town
ees that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one just down the road there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not like the towns. We just go on,
and then go on some more. Maybe we see nice
place, we stop, eh? Maybe not.&rdquo; A teeth-rattling
lurch of the car again demanded his full
attention, and the conversation was cut off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>Burk shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether
we&rsquo;ve done the right thing or not,&rdquo; he said in
a low tone. &ldquo;These people seem to be going
our way; but it remains to be seen whether we&rsquo;re
any better off than we were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Burk&mdash;those people from the lake
would have found us in no time if we hadn&rsquo;t got
this lift! And now we&rsquo;re going south, even if it&rsquo;s
not very fast. And we&rsquo;re hidden here under this
cover, so that nobody will see us, even if the
police have sent out a description.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burk nodded soberly. &ldquo;I guess so. But you
can be sure this highway is the first place they&rsquo;ll
watch.&rdquo; He peeped out through the flap in the
back of the caravan. &ldquo;Look; we&rsquo;re almost into
Wallistown; if he stops here, I might as well be
back in my cell at the prison right now. I know
this was the only thing we could do; but maybe
we&rsquo;ve jumped out of the frying pan into the
fire.&rdquo; The hunted man had never been at his
ease among crowds of people; now, he felt doubly
unsure.</p>
<p>Jake tried to reassure him. &ldquo;Cheer up! We&rsquo;re
snug enough here for a while, and it&rsquo;ll give us
time to think up a plan. We&rsquo;ll make it yet, old
timer! Now, if I only knew where Jerry was,
I think I&rsquo;d feel pretty good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>The creaking van shivered to a halt; bumped
forward again. Burk chanced another look outside.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve crossed the main street of town,&rdquo;
he whispered. &ldquo;Looks like we&rsquo;re going south
after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; Jake replied.
&ldquo;You see&mdash;it was a lucky thing we were able
to help out these gypsies, or whatever they are.
If the cops can find us here in this travelling
house, they&rsquo;re pretty good. Keep a stiff upper
lip, and we&rsquo;ll make Canoe Mountain before
dark!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SHOTS ON THE HIGHWAY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought you&rsquo;d turn up again,&rdquo; repeated
Diker. Jerry felt the man&rsquo;s hand
tighten on his arm. &ldquo;You twins seem to have a
habit of popping into sight when least expected.
The question is, which one are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s easily found out,&rdquo; his captor
went on. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how or when you got
away, but if you were with Burk when the dogs
made him take to water, your legs ought to be
wet. They&rsquo;re not. Therefore, we&rsquo;ll get your
brother when we get Burk.&rdquo; He raised his voice
to speak to the man at Jerry&rsquo;s left. &ldquo;See, Warden&mdash;I
told you this was one of &rsquo;em. Good thing
I spotted him when he was topping that fence,
eh? Well, now Frank can step on the gas. The
others may be ahead of us, or they may be behind,
but sooner or later, we&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>The jolly-looking man at Jerry&rsquo;s left now put
in a word. &ldquo;What was the big idea, son?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d think you were old enough to know
better than to trifle with the law, and help a convict
get away. All your leaders back there at
the camp are worried to death about you kids.
Didn&rsquo;t you think of that? Where were you trying
to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone would have done the same thing!&rdquo;
Jerry burst out at last. &ldquo;Burk told us he wasn&rsquo;t
guilty, and we wanted to help him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jolly man smiled, looking jollier than ever.
&ldquo;My boy, I&rsquo;ve been a prison warden for twelve
years, and I&rsquo;ve never had a man in my charge
who&rsquo;d admit he was guilty! Innocent men, every
one of them&mdash;to hear them tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry, in his efforts to show Burk&rsquo;s innocence,
forgot himself. &ldquo;Let him stay free a little
longer, and he&rsquo;ll prove he&rsquo;s not guilty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he will, will he?&rdquo; the man said sharply.
&ldquo;How will he do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy realized that he had said more than
enough. He sank back in his seat. But Diker, it
seemed, was not through with his questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get down here to town so
quickly?&rdquo; he asked. Jerry shook his head.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t, tell anything, eh? Well, we&rsquo;ll find out
all about it later. I don&rsquo;t think you know where
the others are anyway. You&rsquo;re just like the
skinny lad we treed up in the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sherlock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That his name? He wouldn&rsquo;t say a word to
us&mdash;all he did was sneeze. I left Harris to take
him along back. We got him, and now we&rsquo;ve got
you&mdash;and the rest of the crowd can&rsquo;t be far
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car slowed to a halt at a crossroads, where
a motorcycle policeman in the khaki uniform of a
state officer sat vigilantly astride his machine.
Diker jumped out, and ran across to the man,
hailing him as he came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See anything?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The man in khaki shook his head. &ldquo;Nothing
unusual. I&rsquo;d swear they haven&rsquo;t come along this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, keep your eyes open,&rdquo; he was admonished.
&ldquo;That plane up there will keep them
from bolting toward the hills again. So long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diker jumped back into his seat, and again
the car slid forward. Twice more, as the miles
went by, it stopped at the side of the road, and
Diker spoke to men who seemed to be posted on
guard. Once, they passed a car drawn up by the
side of the road. It was a queer-looking affair,
Jerry noted, with a canvas top like a prairie
schooner, and a chubby little man who looked
like a foreigner was pumping up a tire. They
drove by this roadside scene so rapidly, however,
that Jerry could not make out any details.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>Some time in the middle of the afternoon, the
big car drew up in front of the post-office of a
little hamlet about fifteen miles south of Wallistown.
The driver got out and entered a small
restaurant whose sign proclaimed it the &ldquo;Apple
Hill Cafe&mdash;Tourists a Speciality&rdquo;; he returned
with an armful of sandwiches and four bottles
of pop. Diker waved to Jerry to share this
sketchy repast, and the boy was too famished to
refuse, since his only previous nourishment that
day had been a few elderberries, hours and hours
before. He put away three ham sandwiches in
almost no time at all, and started to demolish one
of the large apples which the driver, whose name
was Frank something-or-other, had brought out
in his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Warden,&rdquo; said Diker conversationally,
taking a long pull at his bottle of pop, &ldquo;they
surely couldn&rsquo;t have gotten this far down in the
time since we know they got ashore up by Wallistown.
Either they&rsquo;re off the road altogether, or
else we&rsquo;ve slipped up somehow. I guess we&rsquo;ll
have to turn back. Shame to make you waste
time on the chase this way, but you know how it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;Burk used to live down this way, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
asked the jolly-faced warden. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll know his
way around now, if he&rsquo;s gotten this far. No; I
don&rsquo;t mind taking the time to end off this affair
properly. I&rsquo;m curious to find out what our friend
Burk is trying to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re ready to start back then, we&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
Diker motioned to the driver, who circled around
the Apple Hill Post-Office, and the car started
on the return journey.</p>
<p>About two miles out of Apple Hill, Frank
slammed on the brakes. A man stood in the
center of the road, waving at them. Jerry recognized
him as one of the watchers they had spoken
to on the journey down; a farmerish-looking man
who seemed to be some sort of constable. Without
delay, he ran to the side of the car, and hurriedly
addressed the prison guard. &ldquo;Jest got a
telephone call from the police-station in Wallistown,&rdquo;
was his message. &ldquo;They been inquirin&rsquo;
around like, and found a feller who was workin&rsquo;
over on the side of the lake where your man was
seen to land from a canoe. This feller&mdash;road-mender,
he is&mdash;was workin&rsquo; by the side of the
highway, and noticed some sort of outlandish
automobile stopped there for quite a while. He
didn&rsquo;t see nothin&rsquo; of this convict feller, but he
says if ye can find this queer auto, the feller
drivin&rsquo; might know somethin&rsquo; to help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did this car look like?&rdquo; asked the
warden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like nothin&rsquo; else in the world, seems like.
Said it had a canvas top, like a Conestoga wagon,
all fixed up to live in&mdash;the driver was a fat little
feller that looked like a wop, and he had his
missus along. Catch that pair, and mebbe they&rsquo;ll
tell you somethin&rsquo; ye ought to know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We passed that outfit up the road&mdash;remember?&rdquo;
burst out Diker. &ldquo;Full speed ahead,
Frank! They were fixin&rsquo; up a tire when I saw
&rsquo;em&mdash;they can&rsquo;t be very far from here! And
pass me that gun of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank carefully passed Diker&rsquo;s shotgun over
the back of his seat, and the car roared ahead.
Jerry peered forward with the rest. He had seen
that caravan and its funny little owner. Did he
know anything about Jake and Burk? Was it
even possible that&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>They rounded a sharp bend in the road.
&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; whooped Diker. &ldquo;Draw up beside
them, and we&rsquo;ll see what they know!&rdquo; Again
the driver slammed on the brakes, and the car
screamed to a halt a few yards ahead of the oncoming
van. Diker jumped out, shotgun in hand,
and stood in front of the strange canvas-covered
car. &ldquo;Halt, in the name of the law!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>The caravan shivered to a rattling stop. The
dark, fat couple on the seat began jabbering at
each other in some outlandish tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that!&rdquo; came Diker&rsquo;s command.
&ldquo;Come down here in the road! Now, I just want
you to answer a few questions&mdash;&mdash; Quiet! How
do you expect me to talk when you&rsquo;re gabblin&rsquo;
like a bunch of turkeys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ees it you do, Meester?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down, I say! That&rsquo;s right&mdash;now bring
the lady.&rdquo; Diker turned to his chief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring
&rsquo;em over to you, Warden, so you can ask &rsquo;em
anything you like. Over here, please! Gypsies,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry, from his seat in the car, could look down
upon the heads of the two dark little people who
were now lost in the cross-fire of questions put
to them by Diker and the warden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you stopped up by Lake Wallis a few
hours ago. We&rsquo;re looking for a man, a convict,
who has escaped and who was last seen at the
place you stopped. Know anything about him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>The little man almost had tears in his large
rolling black eyes. &ldquo;Ah, Meester, I have hear of
that wicked man! No, thanks to the saints I
have seen no wicked man&mdash;eh, Maria?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His gestures were comical, but Jerry Utway
was not watching. Did his eyes deceive him, or
was there a ripple of movement behind the canvas
top of the other car? Was it really true that
Jake and the man Burk were&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the little stranger went on; &ldquo;there was
no wicked man. But&mdash;wait a meenit&mdash;there was
a very good man, a good man who help me poosh&mdash;and
a very good leetle boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry, who had not taken his eyes from the
opening in the canvas front of the caravan, bit
his lip to keep from shouting. For an instant, he
had seen a pale face peeping out there, and it was
Jake&rsquo;s face! They were in that car, hiding under
the canvas top! In another second the fat, voluble
little man would give them away, and then it
would be all over!</p>
<p>Diker shifted his gun. &ldquo;A man and a boy?&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>Jerry saw his chance. All eyes were upon the
strange couple. With a swift movement, he
leaned forward, over the driver&rsquo;s shoulder. The
keys to the ignition were still in the lock on the
dashboard. Deftly he switched them off, and
threw the bunch of keys as far as he could into
the bushes on the other side of the road!</p>
<p>The men of the law, intent on their questioning,
had been taken off guard. For a moment
they did not comprehend what had happened;
and in that moment Jerry Utway screamed his
warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Drive ahead, Jakie&mdash;drive!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt the warden&rsquo;s arms about him; he could
not move. The driver shouted: &ldquo;He chucked
away the keys!&rdquo; and jumped out of the car, colliding
with the bewildered Diker. A motor
whirred noisily; the ungainly caravan lurched
slowly forward. And Jake, good old Jakie, was
bending over the wheel, driving for dear life!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Drive!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>The man called Frank was trying to disentangle
himself from Diker&rsquo;s arms, still shouting:
&ldquo;He chucked away the keys! We can&rsquo;t chase
them until we get those keys!&rdquo; Diker fought
his way free, bumped into the fat, frightened-looking
dark man, and at last got clear. He
started to run up the road in the wake of the
caravan, which had slowly gained speed and was
rattling south at a good rate. Seeing that he
could not hope to overtake the car on foot, he
stopped short, yelled a final command to halt,
and clapped his gun to his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Duck!</i>&rdquo; shrieked Jerry, and felt the warden&rsquo;s
hand clapped over his mouth. A double explosion
boomed from the road. Diker had fired both
barrels. Jerry&rsquo;s eyes hurt as he strained to see
through the smoke. The caravan jerked an instant,
then moved on, gathered speed, and disappeared
from view at a curve in the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE LAST TRAP</span></h2>
<p>In full career, the caravan pitched and creaked
like a ship in a heavy sea. Jake clung grimly
to the wheel, expecting each minute to hear
another rain of lead rattle about his ears; but he
doggedly notched the little car to its highest
speed, holding her to the road.</p>
<p>Old Jerry had done it! In another minute
they would have been bagged without a struggle,
but Jerry had given them the only chance for
freedom in sight. It would take their hunters
some time to locate the keys of the big car, turn
it around, and pursue the van. A few minutes
leeway might do wonders!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, stop, ye fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man with a badge on his lapel was waving
his arms wildly in front. Jake shoved on more
gas; the man who had sought to stop them leaped
blindly for his life, and they passed him in a
cloud of dust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>How far could they get at this rate? Jake
leaned back and shouted, &ldquo;All right, Burk?
&rsquo;Fraid we can&rsquo;t get far, unless we get out of this
bus pretty quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burk&rsquo;s head appeared in the opening. Jake
did not dare turn around, and so did not see that
his partner&rsquo;s face was drawn with pain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;no
use, I guess, old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve been in worse places than this!
Soon as we get a bit farther along, we&rsquo;ll hop out
and take to the hills again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burk shook his head. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make it.
Only thing to do is&mdash;pull up and wait for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Burk,&rdquo; Jake protested; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not
far from Canoe Mountain now! We&rsquo;ll desert
this car and run for it again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do it, son. Not a quitter&mdash;but I
couldn&rsquo;t run very far. Some of that shot caught
me in the leg. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Jake shoved on the brake, and the
caravan rattled to a standstill at the side of the
road. He scrambled through the curtain, and
stared at Burk&rsquo;s blanched face. &ldquo;Let me see&mdash;did
they get you bad? I didn&rsquo;t stop to think they
might&mdash;&mdash; It was that fellow Diker with them;
I knew him right off.&rdquo; He was rolling up the
corduroy trousers on Burk&rsquo;s right leg as he
spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! Looks bad; right in the calf of the
leg. But it might be worse. Do you see anything
around I could use for a bandage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burk shook his head again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother.
The prison people will be along in a minute, and
they&rsquo;ll take care of us. Too bad it had to break
this way; why, we can see Canoe Mountain from
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo; Jake&rsquo;s tone was filled with
eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only about five miles to the lodge. You take
the road that leads out from Apple Hill, just a
little ways down here a piece. At the top of the
first mountain, you turn right on a short lane
that goes straight to the lodge. But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Jake Utway swiftly; &ldquo;can I
leave you here all right? I can see your wound is
pretty bad, and you couldn&rsquo;t walk a step with
that leg; but I&rsquo;m still lively enough. We&rsquo;re not
licked yet. I&rsquo;m going on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake peered out the back of the caravan.
Their enemies were not in sight yet. Burk waved
his hand in feeble protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The game&rsquo;s up, old fellow. What could you
do at&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Burk. But I&rsquo;m going anyway.
I want to have a look at that hunting lodge
of yours. The prison bunch will take care of you
I know. Now, before I leave you, tell me&mdash;have
you been able to remember anything about where
you might have put that necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man groaned softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.
I&rsquo;ve tried and tried&mdash;but I guess it&rsquo;s hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not a minute to waste. Jake
jumped to the ground. &ldquo;So long, Burk! I&rsquo;ll
be seeing you again. Cheer up!&rdquo; he called
gently, and began hiking at a fast gait up the
road toward the little village of Apple Hill.</p>
<p>A forlorn hope, if there ever was one, Jake
Utway told himself as he hastened toward the
nearing cluster of houses that marked the crossroads
town. Of the four of them who had faced
the new day in heartsome spirits, he alone was
the only one still uncaught. First Sherlock, then
Jerry, and now Burk&mdash;one, two, three!&mdash;one
after another they had sacrificed their liberty in
order that the venture should go forward. And
it should go forward, to the very end, Jake
promised himself. Canoe Mountain or bust! It
was part of playing the game, to keep on and on
toward the goal, as long as breath was left to
struggle ahead&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>A boy in overalls was riding slowly toward him
on a bicycle. Jake halted and waved his arm at
the oncoming lad, who pulled to a stop, and eyed
him suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, kiddo,&rdquo; smiled Jake. &ldquo;Where do you
live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy scuffed the toe of his shoe into the
dirt beside the road, and gaped with open mouth
before answering. He jerked a grimy thumb to
the right. &ldquo;Yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to make some money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, do you want to make a little extra
money? Listen; I have to go somewhere pretty
quick. Lend me that bike of yours for a couple
hours, and I&rsquo;ll pay you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake fished in his pocket and pulled out all the
cash he had been able to bring with him. &ldquo;Look!
There&rsquo;s almost four dollars there. Four bucks,
just for letting me ride your old bike for a little
while! I promise to bring it back in good shape.&rdquo;
The farmer lad shook his head. Jake jingled the
money in his palm. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have another
chance to make money this easily!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy pointed a finger at Jake&rsquo;s scout knife,
which he had drawn from his pocket with the
money. &ldquo;What kinda knife&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>Time was getting short. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a swell
knife&mdash;look at all the blades it&rsquo;s got,&rdquo; said Jake
desperately. &ldquo;Tell you what&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give you the
knife and all this money too, if you let me borrow
your wheel for just an hour or two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The added attraction of the knife was enough
to sway the smaller boy&rsquo;s mind. He snatched it
and the coins from Jake&rsquo;s hand, and then slowly
climbed down off his bicycle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making a good swap, kid,&rdquo; said Jake,
gripping the handlebars. He was surprised to
find that the boy, as though he had suddenly
changed his mind, was clinging to the bicycle
with determination. &ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy shook his head. A thought had just
occurred to him. &ldquo;How do I know you&rsquo;ll bring
it back? Maybe you&rsquo;ll bust it, or I&rsquo;ll never see
you again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Jake&rsquo;s patience was rapidly giving out.
&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got sense
enough to take my promise. Well, see this
mackinaw I&rsquo;m wearing? It&rsquo;s a good coat, and
worth two or three measly bikes like this one!&rdquo;
He slipped off the garment, and held it out.
&ldquo;Here, take it. You can keep that until I bring
your bike back safe, just to show you I&rsquo;m not
trying to steal anything. Do you get that?&rdquo;
The boy looked at the coat, then at the money
and knife in his hand. Jake tucked the coat
under the lad&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;All right. You keep the
mackinaw, and in a little while I&rsquo;ll bring this
back to that red house over there&mdash;that&rsquo;s where
you live, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;and get back my coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the boy could change his mind or offer
further objection, Jake climbed into the saddle
and began pedalling down the road toward
Apple Hill. He had not gone far when he heard
a shout behind him, as if the boy had already
doubted the wisdom of his transaction; but he
increased his speed, and was shortly amid the
houses of the town.</p>
<p>He found the road to Canoe Mountain without
any trouble, and speeded off to the westward.
Only a few miles away the low blue line of the
hills, bristling with pine and spruce trees on the
skyline, pointed his goal. About half a mile after
he had left Apple Hill behind, the asphalt paving
ended, and the road became a dusty and rutted
stretch of dirt. A fine powder, stirred up by his
progress, settled on his clothing, coated his face
and choked his nostrils. Yet he kept on, pedalling
as hard as he could go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>Some three miles on his way, he came to the
span of a concrete bridge, which carried the road
across a slowly-moving stream. Jake dismounted,
and wheeled the bicycle beneath the
bridge, where a grassy bank spread invitingly in
the sunshine of the late afternoon. It was warm
there, and restful.... He needed a bit of
rest, to get his breath back.</p>
<p>Jake stretched his limbs out luxuriously. His
hunger made him feel a little light-headed. He
closed his eyes for a moment to shut out the
bright sun. Burk&mdash;Jerry&mdash;the prison guard&mdash;hungry....</p>
<p>He awoke with a start. It was late. The sun
was almost down, now; there was a misty chill in
the air beside the slowly-gliding brook. He
jumped up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
What had happened? The bicycle lying at his
side brought his memory back again. For several
precious hours he had been sleeping; he could
have been at Canoe Mountain Lodge by this
time! Hurriedly he pulled together his scattered
wits, and climbed to the road. The coast was
clear. He pushed the bicycle up the embankment,
mounted, and once more was riding toward the
hills that loomed darkly before him in the dusk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>Timberlands began to line the road now.
Night was dropping its curtain over the countryside;
lights twinkled in far-off farmhouses in the
valley. He was soon aware that the road was
rising steadily; he was on the mountainside, surrounded
by dark thickets and ghostly trees; an
uncanny, haunted feeling came over him. He
could hardly see the road before him; he felt for
his flashlight, and smothered an exclamation. He
must have left his light in the pocket of his mackinaw,
now in the possession of the boy back at
Apple Hill.</p>
<p>The road was now too steep for riding; all the
strength of his muscles could not drive the machine
forward. He jumped off, and began a slow
trudge upward, trundling the bicycle beside him.</p>
<p>It took him fully half an hour to reach the
summit of the mountain. The hunting lodge
could not be far away now. If his venture was
a wild goose chase, at any rate that chase would
soon be at an end.</p>
<p>The weariness of his journey had blotted out
all sense of reality; he did not even think of the
hopelessness of burglarizing a strange house and
searching there for evidence of an incident which
had happened more than twelve months ago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>His feet sounded hollowly on some sort of
wooden steps. They must lead up to the door
of the lodge! He leaned his bicycle against a
rustic railing, and stumbled wearily across the
resounding boards of a porch. If only he had his
flashlight! But no matter&mdash;&mdash; This must be the
door. His hand sought out the latch, and he
started back in surprise. It was open!</p>
<p>Could anyone be within? But no, there were
no lights showing anywhere about the place.
Some carelessness, no doubt. He pushed lightly
on the door; it gave before his hand, and he
stepped over the threshold, into a room.</p>
<p>Jake Utway tried to scream, but a lump had
risen in his throat, and he could not get the words
out. In a far corner of the strange room a red
coal, like a cigar-end, glowed and died. A freezing
paralysis of fear ran down his spine; in his
ears pulsed loudly the pounding beat of his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come right in, son,&rdquo; said a voice that was
horribly jovial. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit late. But you&rsquo;ve
come at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door slammed behind him like the crack of
judgment. Some heavy body had thrown itself
against the panels, and now stood ready to bar his
way. All the hazardous escapes of his flight from
Lenape had been of no avail. From this last,
dark trap there was no escape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SECRET OF THE LODGE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo; warned the Voice from the
dark. &ldquo;You can light up the lamp now,
Frank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man at Jake&rsquo;s back felt his way a few
yards to the left. The sound of a match scratched
on the sole of a shoe came to Jake&rsquo;s ear; a tiny
yellow flame blossomed, was held to the wick of
an oil-lamp. The man called Frank replaced the
glass chimney of the lamp, and stepped back to
his post by the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, bud. You must be tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake Utway stared across at the speaker. His
new enemy sat in an armchair by a dead fireplace,
calmly smoking a cigar and smiling easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Jake, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;You look so much like your brother that I feel
I know you already. But no tricks, mind!&rdquo; he
chuckled. &ldquo;That brother of yours has fooled us
enough for one day&mdash;throwing the keys of the
car away, just when he saw his chance to help
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>Never taking his eyes from the smiling man,
Jake sank into a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! We&rsquo;ll be heading back in a
few minutes; might as well get your breath before
we go. Now, Jake, you can tell me just
exactly what you expected to do here at this
lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, sir?&rdquo; Jake countered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you didn&rsquo;t see me in the car when
we stopped your covered wagon up the road. I
happen to be warden of the Elmville Penitentiary&mdash;your
friend Burk escaped from my
charge, and naturally I wanted to get him back
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he&mdash;Burk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you worry about him! He got a
few buckshot in the leg, but we bandaged him
up, and he&rsquo;ll be walking around as good as ever
in a day or two. He&rsquo;s gone back with Diker and
your brother some time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you I was coming here?&rdquo; demanded
Jake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burk himself. Told me you&rsquo;d been good to
him, and he didn&rsquo;t want you to come to harm.
Very earnest about it, too. Yes, I must say I&rsquo;m
learning a lot about our friend Burk in these last
few days.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Jake considered. &ldquo;Have you found out that
he&rsquo;s not a thief?&rdquo; he asked boldly.</p>
<p>Again the man smiled, wearily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
pretty young, Jake. I admit Burk was always
well-behaved when he was serving his time, and
he looks like a decent sort. No doubt he told you
a yarn that sounded convincing enough&mdash;why,
every man at Elmville can make himself out to
be a saint, if you give him a chance! But I have
yet to find any proof that John Burk was not
given every benefit of the doubt when his case
was tried at law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake struggled upright, his eyes blazing. &ldquo;It&mdash;it
might be law, but is it justice? Why, sir,
he&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The boy fell back, his strength
spent. The warden jumped up and came to his
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, son&mdash;you must be worn out! Frank,
get that thermos bottle of hot chocolate from the
car, and have that caretaker make up some sandwiches.&rdquo;
He patted Jake&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Bet you
haven&rsquo;t had a thing to eat to-day. No wonder
you look worn out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy closed his eyes. &ldquo;I am tired, I guess.
But I really mean it, sir. Burk didn&rsquo;t steal that
necklace any more than I did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Don&rsquo;t talk any more now. We&rsquo;ll
have some hot food for you in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man resumed his seat, and began puffing
on his cigar in silence. As the minutes passed,
Jake looked about him. The room seemed to be
the main hall of the hunting lodge. Over the fireplace
he made out a dim shape, the mounted head
of a large buck deer. The walls were hung with
Indian blankets; a case of books stood in one
corner, and a rack of guns and fishing-rods in
another. The place was fitted out in rough comfort,
and at another time Jake might have
delighted in examining everything which the
sportsmen who owned the club had collected. As
it was, he waited motionless until Frank reappeared
with a steaming cup of chocolate, some
sandwiches, and a dish of hot soup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel better now?&rdquo; the warden asked, as Jake
swallowed the last of the heartening liquid. The
man had removed his hat, and Jake could now see
that his hair was snow-white. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re ready
for a ride, there&rsquo;s nothing to keep us here any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but, sir, give me a chance to explain!&rdquo;
The warm food had brought back much of Jake&rsquo;s
strength, and with it his fighting spirit. If they
departed from Canoe Mountain Lodge now,
there would never be another opportunity to clear
up the mystery of the necklace, and Burk would
be worse off than before. Here, if anywhere, lay
the heart of that mystery, and although Jake
Utway had no clear idea as to the way of its solution,
he felt that the walls of the lodge must contain
some clue that would lead them to the truth.</p>
<p>The warden shook his head patiently. &ldquo;You
fellows have risked everything to get to this
place, but Burk himself confessed to me awhile
ago that he had no definite aim in view, except
to hunt around some more for that necklace.
What can you know that he doesn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake stood up. Strength was flooding back
into his aching body, and he spoke with a confidence
that could not fail to impress the white-haired
man. It was a confidence based not upon
reason, but upon the boy&rsquo;s feeling that Burk had
spoken the truth. Into his mind flashed the picture
of that night of storm across the lake from
the Lenape dock; he could almost see the convict&rsquo;s
drawn face, and hear the earnest ring of his
voice as he told his story to his two young captors&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Warden,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I feel sure that
you know there&rsquo;s something strange about this
case of Burk&rsquo;s; otherwise, you wouldn&rsquo;t have
taken so much trouble to talk to him after you
caught him, or to come here and wait for me.
You believe that the law is right, but you&rsquo;re not
sure in your mind that a mistake hasn&rsquo;t been
made; and you want to be fair to Burk and give
him a chance to prove that there has been a mistake.
Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jollity of the warden&rsquo;s face dropped from
it like a mask. He leaned forward, and his cigar
dropped from his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be so, son. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve asked yourself: Why didn&rsquo;t Burk
get far away from this part of the country when
he had the chance? Why did he risk getting
caught, as he was caught, simply to come here to
Canoe Mountain, if he knew he was guilty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warden leaned back again. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easily
explained, Jake. Many times a man will give
way to temptation, and steal something of great
value. Even if he&rsquo;s caught, he will refuse to tell
where he has hidden the thing, hoping that when
he gets out of prison he will be able to come back,
take the object from its hiding-place, and sell it
for what he can get. Burk knew where he had
hidden the necklace, and was coming back to get
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I could prove to you that Burk
didn&rsquo;t know where he put it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man smiled, and shook his head. &ldquo;That
would be a mighty hard thing to prove. But if
you could do that, and the necklace was restored
to its owner, it might make some difference&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Now, here&rsquo;s another thing. Why
should Burk steal that necklace? He had never
done anything like that before. He had a good
job, which he liked, and as caretaker here had
been in a position of trust. He must have known
that he would be caught at once. He might have
run away with the pearls in Mr. Collinge&rsquo;s absence;
but he was still here, and didn&rsquo;t try to get
away. He has said all along that he was innocent.
The disappearance of the necklace has
brought him nothing but trouble. Why should
he risk ruining his whole life to take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d make a good lawyer, Jake!&rdquo; the man
said slowly. &ldquo;Hear that, Frank? The lad is
convincing me in spite of myself. But you
haven&rsquo;t answered the big question, Bud: What
did happen to that necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that.&rdquo; Jake&rsquo;s words were
coming out in a rush now. He must make them
understand; he must prove to them that his
friend Burk, by this time no doubt back again in
his hated cage, was blameless of this crime.
&ldquo;What happened to the necklace? The answer
is: Burk was sick. Have you ever had the &rsquo;flu?
Then you can picture what happened to him that
day. He was out of his head. His one thought
must have been to put the thing in a safe place,
and then lie down on his bed in peace. Can you
blame him for not being able to remember what
he had done, or where he hid the thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why wasn&rsquo;t it found?&rdquo; the man asked
quickly. &ldquo;A valuable thing like a necklace
doesn&rsquo;t disappear so easily. And the case was
well-known; why, I&rsquo;ll venture to say that this
whole place here has been gone over with a fine-tooth
comb at least a dozen times in the past
year! And as far as we know, the necklace has
never been found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake cast his eyes about the large room, noting
where several doors led off to the back of the
lodge. &ldquo;Tell me, sir,&rdquo; he said at last; &ldquo;if the
necklace could be found, and if it could be proved
that Burk was sick and didn&rsquo;t know what he had
done with it&mdash;that he had hidden it for safekeeping,
and not for his own gain&mdash;would Burk
be set free?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;I could safely say,&rdquo; said the warden, &ldquo;that
if such was the case, the facts would be put before
the Pardon Board, and I myself would make
a point of urging that Burk be released. But
you can see for yourself that it&rsquo;s an almost impossible
job. Now, let&rsquo;s forget all this foolishness,
and start back. It&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake did not move. &ldquo;Did you say that the
man who is now the caretaker is in back somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I talk to him, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warden opened his mouth as if to object,
but thought better of it, and in a forbearing tone
asked the chauffeur, Frank, to call the caretaker.</p>
<p>The latter must have been just outside the
door, in the kitchen of the lodge, for he shambled
in at once, looking with curious eyes at the
strangers who had invaded his domain in the
name of the law. He was a bent little man, with
a drooping brown mustache, and he stood in
silence, resting on one foot, waiting for someone
to speak.</p>
<p>Jake faced him. &ldquo;Can you show me the room
where Burk used to sleep, when he was working
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The caretaker darted a look at the warden,
who motioned for him to answer. &ldquo;Wal, yes,
guess I can. Sleep there myself; my room now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>He led the way toward the rear of the building,
and the others followed, with Frank bearing
the oil-lamp behind them. The room which they
entered lay in the far corner of the lodge, a
narrow little place with brown boarded walls,
within which there was barely space enough for
a small cot-bed, a chair, and a tiny dresser. The
warden surveyed the room curiously, but Jake
went straight to the bed, and turned down the
covers. Then he wheeled on the caretaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this bed the same as when Burk was
here?&rdquo; he asked sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, just about. Covers are the same,
mostly, but that there&rsquo;s a new mattress I just got
last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the old mattress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chucked it outside on the woodpile. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake Utway did not pause to reply. In an
instant he was into the hall, racing through the
lighted kitchen, and out the back door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him!&rdquo; shouted the warden. &ldquo;Get him,
Frank! It&rsquo;s another trick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>But Jake had gone no farther than the woodpile.
In the light that streamed from the open
kitchen window, he was feeling about among the
wreckage of a worn-out cotton mattress, which
had been thrown upon the heap of firewood in
the rear of the lodge. Frank, still carrying the
lamp, held his arm until the warden and the caretaker
joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; cried Jake impatiently. &ldquo;Hold
that lamp down closer, will you? I can&rsquo;t see very
well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the warden.
His words were cut short. Jake had found a
short slit in the heavy striped ticking that encased
the stuffing of the old mattress. His hand
slid through; he felt about for a moment, and
drew his hand out again. In the yellow light of
the lamp, everyone could see the object which
dangled from his clenched fingers. A short string
of gleaming, milky-white bubbles flashed before
the astounded eyes of the three men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a long guess, but it was right!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jake Utway in triumph. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the
pearl necklace, safe and sound! Burk wouldn&rsquo;t
have put it away in a place like this, if he hadn&rsquo;t
been sick, and it was the first place he thought
of hiding them! And now, Mr. Warden&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
hold you to your promise to do all you can to set
John Burk free!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">BROTHERLY LOVE</span></h2>
<p>Jake Utway woke from a restless doze as
the car bumped over the rough road behind
Camp Lenape. He looked about him with sleep-sodden
eyes as the driver, Frank, drew up outside
the lodge. There was a light in the Chief&rsquo;s
office, and the Chief himself must have heard the
noise of their motor, for he appeared at once,
holding up a lantern so that he could see the
newcomers.</p>
<p>His face lighted up as he saw Jake, huddled
in the back of the machine beside the warden of
Elmville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there you are at last!&rdquo; he exclaimed
with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Jerry has been in bed
for an hour, and I stayed up on the chance that
I might hear something of you. Now that you&rsquo;re
really here, I admit that a big load is off my
mind.&rdquo; He turned to the warden. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know how to thank you, sir, for picking up the
boys as you have done. I&rsquo;m sorry that two
Lenape fellows have caused you so much
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble!&rdquo; cried the warden genially.
&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s not keep young Jake here away from
his bed any longer with all our talk. He&rsquo;s earned
a good night&rsquo;s sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so? Well, hop along, Jake. We&rsquo;ll
talk this over with you and your brother in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words sounded ominous, but Jake was too
tired to worry about what the morning would
bring. He stumbled off toward Tent Ten, hardly
aware of what he was doing; but as he left, he
heard the Chief invite the two men into the lodge
for a cup of coffee, and the three of them disappeared
into the building talking together in
confidential tones. Jake fell like a log upon his
bunk, without taking off any of his stained garments;
but Mr. Avery was awake, and soon
tucked the worn-out boy between his blankets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>The next morning, after breakfast, the Utway
twins stood outside the door of the Chief&rsquo;s office
with beating hearts. They had not been given
any chance to speak to each other since their
separate returns to camp late the previous night;
and now that they were back in the familiar
scenes of Lenape, their wild adventure seemed
like a mad dream. How could they have run
away from camp without thinking of the worry
and trouble that this disobedient act would cause
their leaders and the Chief?</p>
<p>Jerry knocked shakily upon the door. At the
call of &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; the two culprits entered the
office and stood waiting for judgment.</p>
<p>They could not read the look on the Chief&rsquo;s
face as he stood regarding them quizzically.
&ldquo;We-ell!&rdquo; he said slowly, and paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;re sorry, Chief!&rdquo; blurted out
Jerry. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t think about making a lot of
trouble for you and our leaders. We just wanted
to help&mdash;&mdash; But I guess it&rsquo;s no use trying to tell
how we felt about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you did right in leaving
Lenape without telling anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry shook his head miserably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you, Jake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry too, Chief. We thought we were
helping Burk, but maybe we were wrong. When
you put it up to us that way, it makes us feel as
if we&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>The man nodded. &ldquo;I could talk to you for an
hour about camp discipline, and it wouldn&rsquo;t mean
as much to you as those words of yours mean,
boys. Your own consciences are better judges
than I could ever hope to be. And I won&rsquo;t say
that you didn&rsquo;t have some excuse. As things
have turned out, no harm has been done, luckily
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief tapped with a pencil on his desk for
an instant, and then began speaking softly, almost
to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talked with the warden last night after you
went to bed, Jake. And he said several things
about you boys which I won&rsquo;t repeat; but he
made me see that Lenape hasn&rsquo;t done all it might
do for you two. From now on, I shall expect
you to use all your extra energy in being better
campers. You both have lots of pep, and in
Burk&rsquo;s case your efforts turned out to be of great
value. Keep on putting that pep to work to help
the other fellow at Lenape! You know how to
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose with a smile, and held out his hand.
The twins straightened, and looked their leader
full in the eyes. &ldquo;Thanks, Chief,&rdquo; said Jerry
huskily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure will!&rdquo; added Jake.</p>
<p>Silently the Chief took their hands, and gave
each a hearty grip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way, boys,&rdquo; he said, as they turned
to go, &ldquo;I have some news for you. Last night
the warden told me some things about this fellow
Burk that interested me a lot. When he&rsquo;s free
again, as he should be if the warden means what
he says, I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if I could find a
job around camp where Burk might be of use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake and Jerry Utway held back their feelings
until they were almost out on the porch.
Then they broke loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray for Chief!&rdquo; they shouted. &ldquo;Yay,
Chief! Yay, Lenape!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The hospital tent was full to overflowing with
laughing boys. In the midst of them, clad in
pajamas, Sherlock Jones sat up in a comfortable
white bed, leaning back on his pillows with
sparkling eyes. Now and then he paused in his
talk to blow his long nose resoundingly, but
otherwise seemed none the worse for his adventure
on the mountain and his wetting in the brook
when the hounds were on his trail. He was the
center of interest, and it was plain to be seen that
he was enjoying his brief moment in the limelight
of fame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>About him sat or stood all the members of the
Tent Ten group, and a number of other boys who
listened joyously to his tale. Chink Towner and
Wild Willie Sanders perched at the foot of his
bed; Fat Crampton, with wide eyes and open
mouth, hung upon his words; Steve Link was
there, and Sunfish Linder, and Spaghetti
Megaro, and many others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were you scared when those big bloodhounds
jumped up at the tree and tried to get
you?&rdquo; piped up little Pete Lister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I hung on and said my prayers!&rdquo; answered
Sherlock amid laughter. &ldquo;But pretty
soon along came a man named Harris, and he
chained &rsquo;em up, and after that it was all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did Jake and the man get away so
quick?&rdquo; asked Soapy Mullins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to ask him that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to ask him this morning,&rdquo; put in Lefkowitz,
&ldquo;but he wouldn&rsquo;t tell me a thing. But
he came to camp real late last night; I was awake
and saw him get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll know all about it pretty soon,&rdquo; observed
Gil Shelton, who was sitting on the steps
of the tent. &ldquo;Here they both come now, up from
the lodge. Guess they want to see you, Sherlock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Sherlock drew forth his handkerchief. &ldquo;I used
to think I was some punkins as a detective,&rdquo; he
announced, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll say right here that the
Utway twins have got it all over me when it
comes to solving mysteries. From now on, I resign!
A thousand mysteries can happen around
this camp, and I won&rsquo;t lift my little finger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low cheer broke forth as the two brothers
stepped into the shadow of the tent-house.
&ldquo;Yay, Jake! Yay, Jerry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake grinned. &ldquo;Hello, Sherlock, old boy!
How have you been since I last saw you? Get
down that tree all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sherlock smiled back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right. How
are you two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re cinders,&rdquo; announced Jerry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
just been listening to the Chief, and boy, we&rsquo;re
never going to run away from camp again!
From now on, I&rsquo;m going to be the best little boy
you ever saw. And I really mean it. I felt like
a penny waiting for change after the Chief got
through talking. Man, I&rsquo;d sooner get pinched
by the cops ten times, than have the Chief look
at me like that again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;You said it,&rdquo; added Jake. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather get
shot at ten times than feel as low as I did just
now. But the Chief is one grand fellow. He
made us see how wrong we were to run away
from Lenape the way we did, but he knew what
really happened, and said he hoped Burk would
get his pardon soon, and that he&rsquo;d find a job
around camp for Burk to do when he got out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what did happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did Burk get caught?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you all the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Questions rose from a dozen clamorous throats,
and the crowd of excited campers closed in about
the two brothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jerry slowly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll take a long
time to tell. We were only away from camp for
one day, but boy, what a day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed like a hundred years!&rdquo; agreed
Jake. &ldquo;And say, wasn&rsquo;t that farmer kid surprised
when we drove up last night and I gave
him back his bicycle! Guess he thought he had
my mackinaw for keeps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to
write to that storekeeper down at Wallistown to
send mine back. But you fellows will have to
get Jake to tell the story. He&rsquo;s the one that did
everything, and got to Canoe Mountain. I got
nabbed before we were half-way there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; said Jake scornfully. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
have got very far if you hadn&rsquo;t seen us in the
gypsy flivver, and hadn&rsquo;t thrown away the keys
to the warden&rsquo;s car. And it was your idea for us
to go to Canoe Mountain in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t anything. But I call it real
smart of you to figure out that Burk had stowed
away those pearls in his mattress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Jerry Utway!&rdquo; said Jake, and there
was a glint in his bright blue eyes. &ldquo;We found
Burk together, and we never could have put it
across if we hadn&rsquo;t been working together all the
time. Sherlock here helped a lot, too, although
he didn&rsquo;t know it. Now, for goodness sake, nail
up that trap of yours until you can say something
with some sense to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not!&rdquo; answered Jerry stoutly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hero, that&rsquo;s what you are&mdash;a bloomin&rsquo;
hero!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not! Don&rsquo;t call me names! Take that
back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are, too! I won&rsquo;t take it back. You&rsquo;re
a bloomin&rsquo; hero!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Jake seized a heavy hot-water bottle that lay
at the foot of Sherlock&rsquo;s bed, and wielded it
threateningly. The circle of boys widened about
the two brothers, and laughing campers nudged
each other and winked. For almost a week now,
the Utway twins had been strangely peaceable.
They had been driven by the mystery that had
surrounded Camp Lenape to join forces and forget
their brotherly strife in a common cause and
in the face of a common danger. But now that
they were back home again at Lenape, a friendly
little battle might clear the air, make them feel
themselves once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the boy, Jake!&rdquo; urged Chink Towner.
&ldquo;Give him the works!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Key down, you Chinaman!&rdquo; cried Jake. &ldquo;I
know what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; Again he wielded the
hot-water bottle menacingly, hefting it as if on
the point of hurling it full at his brother. &ldquo;Now,
Jerry, you take that back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hero, a bloomin&rsquo; hero!&rdquo; chanted
Jerry, tauntingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re another!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re his brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sherlock Jones flashed a mock-terrified glance
at the two embattled brothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; he cried, and slid down into the bed,
pulling the covers protectingly over his head.
&ldquo;The Utway twins are at it again!&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
